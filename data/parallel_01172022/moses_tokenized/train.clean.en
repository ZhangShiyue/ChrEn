Peter 1 : 21
Genesis
Chapter 1
in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth .
and the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep . and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters .
and God said , Let there be light : and there was light .
and God saw the light , that it was good : and God divided the light from the darkness .
and God called the light Day , and the darkness he called Night . and the evening and the morning were the first day .
and God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
and God called the firmament Heaven , And the evening and the morning were the second day .
and God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
and God called the dry land Earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
and the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and the evening and the morning were the third day .
and God said , Let there be lights in e firmament of the heaven to divide Ne day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for Ways , and years :
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
and God made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he made the stars also .
and God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and God saw that it was good .
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day .
and God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and God created great whales , and every living creature that moveth , which the waters brought forth abundantly , after their kind , and every winged fowl after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God blessed them , saying , Be ( fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply in the earth .
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
so God created man in his own image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them .
and God blessed them , and God said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth .
and God said , Behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
and God saw every thing that he had made , and , behold , it was very good . and the evening and the morning were the sixth day .
Chapter 2
thus the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them .
and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
and God blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it : because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens ,
Andevery plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
but there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
and the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
and the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
and out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
and a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads .
the name of the first is Pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
and the name of the second river is Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia .
and the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria . and the fourth river is Euphrates .
and the LORD God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
and the LORD God commanded the man , saying , Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the LORD God said , It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him an help meet for him .
and out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them : and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof .
and Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him .
and the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and he slept : and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ;
and the rib , which the LORD God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
and Adam said , This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
Chapter 3
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . and he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
and the woman said unto the serpent , We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden :
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and the serpent said unto the woman , Ye shall not surely die :
for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat .
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
and they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
and the LORD God called unto Adam , and said unto him , Where art thou ?
and he said , I heard thy voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .
and he said , Who told thee that thou wast naked ? hast thou eaten of the tree , whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
and the man said , The woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
and the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ? and the woman said , The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat .
and the LORD God said unto the serpent , Because thou hast done this , thou art cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life :
AndI will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and her seed ; it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt bruise his heel .
unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
and unto Adam he said , Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife , and hast eaten of the tree , of which I commanded thee , saying , Thou shalt not eat of it : cursed is the ground for thy sake ; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life ;
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it wast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
and Adam called his wife ’ s name Eve ; because she was the mother of all living .
unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins , and clothed them .
and the LORD God said , Behold , the man is become as one of us , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever :
therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from whence he was taken .
so he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life .
Chapter 4
and Adam knew Eve his wife ; and she conceived , and bare Cain , and said , I have gotten a man from the LORD .
and she again bare his brother Abel . and Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground .
and in process of time it came to pass , that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD .
and Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering :
but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect . and Cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
and the LORD said unto Cain , Why art thou wroth ? and why is thy countenance fallen ?
if thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door . and unto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule over him .
and Cain talked with Abel his brother : and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother , and slew him .
and the LORD said unto Cain , Where is Abel thy brother ? and he said , I know not : am I my brother ’ s keeper ?
and he said , What hast thou done ? the voice of thy brother ’ s blood crieth unto me from the ground .
and now art thou cursed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother ’ s blood from thy hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
and Cain said unto the LORD , My punishment is greater than I can bear .
behold , thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth ; and from thy face shall I be hid ; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that findeth me shall slay me .
and the LORD said unto him , Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain , vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold . and the LORD set a mark upon Cain , lest any finding him should kill him .
and Cain went out from the presence of the LORD , and dwelt in the land of Nod , on the east of Eden .
and Cain knew his wife ; and she conceived , and bare Enoch : and he builded a city , and called the name of the city , after the name of his son , Enoch .
and unto Enoch was born Irad : and Irad begat Mehujael : and Mehujael begat Methusael : and Methusael begat Lamech .
and Lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah .
and Adah bare Jabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents , and of such as have cattle .
and his brother ’ s name was Jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
and Zillah , she also bare Tubalcain , an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah .
and Lamech said unto his wives , Adah and Zillah , Hear my voice ; ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech : for I have slain a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
if Cain shall be avenged sevenfold , truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold .
and Adam knew his wife again ; and she bare a son , and called his name Seth : for God , said she , hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel , whom Cain slew .
and to Seth , to him also there was born a son ; and he called his name Enos : then began men to call upon the name of the LORD .
Chapter 5
this is the book of the generations of Adam . in the day that God created man , in the likeness of God made he him ;
male and female created he them ; and blessed them , and called their name Adam , in the day when they were created .
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name Seth :

and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .

and Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years , and begat Lamech :
and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years : and he died .

and he called his name Noah , saying , This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands , because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed .
and Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years : and he died .
and Noah was five hundred years old : and Noah begat Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
Chapter 6
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
and the LORD said , My spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years .
there were giants in the earth in those days ; and also after that , when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men , and they bare children to them , the same became mighty men which were of old , men of renown .
and GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
and it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
and the LORD said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the creeping thing , and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that have made them .
but Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD .
these are the generations of Noah : Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God .
and Noah begat three sons , Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
the earth also was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
and God looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of : the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
a window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it .
and , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , wherein is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
but with thee will I establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons ’ wives with thee .
and of every living thing of all flesh , two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female .
of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
thus did Noah ; according to all that God commanded him , so did he .
Chapter 7
and the LORD said unto Noah , Come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
of fowls also of the air by sevens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him .
and Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ’ wives with him , into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of fowls , and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth ,
there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark , the male and the female , as God had commanded Noah .
and it came to pass after seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
in the six hundredth year of Noah ’ s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights .
in the selfsame day entered Noah , and Shem , and Ham , and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah ’ s wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ;
they , and every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , every bird of every sort .
and they went in unto Noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , wherein is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the LORD shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high hills , that were under the whole heaven , were covered .
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered .
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creeping things , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they were destroyed from the earth : and Noah only remained alive , and they that were with him in the ark .
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days .
Chapter 8
and God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ;
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
and the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ararat .
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in the tenth month , on the first day of the month , were the tops of the mountains seen .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days , that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made :
and he sent forth a raven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ;
and the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and sent forth the dove ; which returned not again unto him any more .
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year , in the first month , the first day of the month , the waters were dried up from off the earth : and Noah removed the covering of the ark , and looked , and , behold , the face of the ground was dry .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
and God spake unto Noah , saying ,
go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ’ wives with thee .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and Noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ’ wives with him :
every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
and Noah builded an altar unto the LORD ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered purnt offerings on the altar .
and the LORD smelled a sweet savour ; and the LORD said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man ’ s sake ; for the imagination of man ’ s heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again smite any more every thing living , as I have done .
while the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
Chapter 9
and God blessed Noah and his sons , and said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth , and upon every fowl of the air , upon all that moveth upon the earth , and upon all the fishes of the sea ; into your hand are they delivered .
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things .
but flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
and surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man ’ s brother will I require the life of man .
whoso sheddeth man ’ s blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of God made he man .
and you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
and God spake unto Noah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
and I , behold , I establish my covenant with you , and with your seed after you ;
and with every living creature that is with you , of the fowl , of the cattle , and of every beast of the earth with you ; from all that go out of the ark , to every beast of the earth .
and I will establish my covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
and God said , This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you , for perpetual generations :
I do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be seen in the cloud :
and I will remember my covenant , which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh ; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , This is the token of the covenant , which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
and the sons of Noah , that went forth of the ark , were Shem , and Ham , and Japheth : and Ham is the father of Canaan .
these are the three sons of Noah : and of them was the whole earth overspread .
and Noah began to be an husbandman , and he planted a vineyard :
and he drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
and Ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren without .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father ’ s nakedness .
and Noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his younger son had done unto him .
and he said , Cursed be Canaan ; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren .
and he said , Blessed be the LORD God of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant .
God shall enlarge Japheth , and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem ; and Canaan shall be his servant .
and Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
and all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years : and he died .
Chapter 10
now these are the generations of the sons of Noah , Shem , Ham , and Japheth : and unto them were sons born after the flood .
the sons of Japheth ; Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and Tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
and the sons of Gomer ; Ashkenaz , and Riphath , and Togarmah .
and the sons of Javan ; Elishah , and Tarshish , Kittim , and Dodanim .
by these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands ; every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
and the sons of Ham ; Cush , and Mizraim , and Phut , and Canaan .
and the sons of Cush ; Seba , and Havilah , and Sabtah , and Raamah , and Sabtecha : and the sons of Raamah ; Sheba , and Dedan .
and Cush begat Nimrod : he began to be a mighty one in the earth .
he was a mighty hunter before the LORD : Wherefore it is said , Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD .
and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
out of that land went forth Asshur , and builded Nineveh , and the city Rehoboth , and Calah ,
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah : the same is a great city .
and Mizraim begat Ludim , and Anamim , and Lehabim , and Naphtuhim ,
and Pathrusim , and Casluhim , ( out of whom came Philistim , ) and Caphtorim .
and Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn , and Heth ,
and the Jebusite , and the Amorite , and the Girgasite ,
and the Hivite , and the Arkite , and the Sinite ,
and the Arvadite , and the Zemarite , and the Hamathite : and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad .
and the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon , as thou comest to Gerar , unto Gaza ; as thou goest , unto Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboim , even unto Lasha .
these are the sons of Ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their countries , and in their nations .
unto Shem also , the father of all the children of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder , even to him were children born .
22 , The children of Shem ; Elam , and Asshur , and Arphaxad , and Lud , and
and the children of Aram ; Uz , and Hul , and Gether , and Mash .
and Arphaxad begat Salah ; and Salah begat Eber .
and unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother ’ s name was Joktan .
and Joktan begat Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth , and Jerah ,
and Hadoram , and Uzal , and Diklah ,
and Obal , and Abimael , and Sheba ,
and Ophir , and Havilah , and Jobab : all these were the sons of Joktan .
and their dwelling was from Mesha , as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east .
these are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations : and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
Chapter 11
and the whole earth was of one language , and of one speech .
and it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; and they dwelt there .
and they said one to another , Go to , let us make brick , and burn them throughly . and they had brick for stone , and slime had they for morter .
and they said , Go to , let us build us a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name , lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
and the LORD came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of men builded .
and the LORD said , Behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
go to , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another ’ s speech .
so the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off to build the city .
therefore is the name of it called Babel ; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
these are the generations of Shem : Shem was an hundred years old , and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood :
and Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
and Arphaxad lived five and thirty years , and begat Salah :
and Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
and Salah lived thirty years , and begat Eber :
and Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
and Eber lived four and thirty years , and begat Peleg :
and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years , and beat sons and daughters .
and Peleg lived thirty years , and begat Reu :
and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years , and begat sons and daughters .
and Reu lived two and thirty years , and begat Serug :
and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters .
and Serug lived thirty years , and begat Nahor :
and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
and Nahor lived nine and twenty years , and begat Terah :
and Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years , and begat sons and daughters .
and Terah lived seventy years , and begat Abram , Nahor , and Haran .
now these are the generations of Terah : Terah begat Abram , Nahor , and Haran ; and Haran begat Lot .
and Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity , in Ur of the Chaldees .
and Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram ’ s wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor ’ s wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
but Sarai was barren ; she had no child .
and Terah took Abram his son , and Lot the son of Haran his son ’ s son , and Sarai his daughter in law , his son Abram ’ s wife ; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees , to go into the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Haran , and dwelt there .
and the days of Terah were two hundred and five years : and Terah died in Haran .
Chapter 12
now the LORD had said unto Abram , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father ’ s house , unto a land that I will shew thee :
and I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
and I will bless them that bless thee , and curse him that curseth thee : and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed .
so Abram departed , as the LORD had spoken unto him ; and Lot went with him : and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .
and Abram took Sarai his wife , and Lot his brother ’ s son , and all their substance that they had gathered , and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came .
and Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem , unto the plain of Moreh . and the Canaanite was then in the land .
and the LORD appeared unto Abram , and said , Unto thy seed will I give this land : and there builded he an altar unto the LORD , who appeared unto him .
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el , and pitched his tent , having Beth-el on the west , and Hai on the east : and there he builded an altar unto the LORD , and called upon the name of the LORD .
and Abram journeyed , going on still toward the south .
and there was a famine in the land : and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was grievous in the land .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , Behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
say , I pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with me for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it came to pass , that , when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
the princes also of Pharaoh saw her , and commended her before Pharaoh : and the woman was taken into Pharaoh ’ s house .
and he entreated Abram well for her sake : and he had sheep , and oxen , and he asses , and menservants , and maidservants , and she asses , and camels .
and the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram ’ s wife .
and Pharaoh called Abram , and said , What is this that thou hast done unto me ? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
and Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him : and they sent him away , and his wife , and all that he had .
Chapter 13
and Abram went up out of Egypt , he , and his wife , and all that he had , and Lot with him , into the south .
and Abram was very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Beth-el and Hai ;
unto the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first : and there Abram called on the name of the LORD .
and Lot also , which went with Abram , had flocks , and herds , and tents .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
and there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram ’ s cattle and the herdmen of Lot ’ s cattle : and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land .
and Abram said unto Lot , Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee , and between my herdmen and thy herdmen ; for we be brethren .
is not the whole land before thee ? separate thyself , I pray thee , from me : if thou wilt take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or if thou depart to the right hand , then I will go to the left .
and Lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of Jordan , that it was well watered every where , before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah , even as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou comest unto Zoar .
then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan ; and Lot journeyed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan , and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain , and pitched his tent toward Sodom .
but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly .
and the LORD said unto Abram , after that Lot was separated from him , Lift up now thine eyes , and look from the place where thou art northward , and southward , and eastward , and westward :
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed for ever .
and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for I will give it unto thee .
then Abram removed his tent , and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre , which is in Hebron , and built there an altar unto the LORD .
Chapter 14
and it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar , Arioch king of Ellasar , Chedorlaomer king of Elam , and Tidal king of nations ;
that these made war with Bera king of Sodom , and with Birsha king of Gomorrah , Shinab king of Admah , and Shemeber king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela , which is Zoar .
all these were joined together in the vale of Siddim , which is the salt sea .
twelve years they served Chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
and in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer , and the kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim , and the Zuzims in Ham , and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim ,
and the Horites in their mount Seir , unto El-paran , which is by the wilderness .
and they returned , and came to Enmishpat , which is Kadesh , and smote all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar .
and there went out the king of Sodom , and the king of Gomorrah , and the king of Admah , and the king of Zeboiim , and the king of Bela ( the same is Zoar ; ) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim ;
with Chedorlaomer the king of Elam , and with Tidal king of nations , and Amraphel king of Shinar , and Arioch king of Ellasar ; four kings with five .
and the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits ; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and fell there ; and they that remained fled to the mountain .
and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
and they took Lot , Abram ’ s brother ’ s son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Abram the Hebrew ; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite , brother of Eshcol , and brother of Aner : and these were confederate with Abram .
and when Abram heard that his prother was taken captive , he armed pis trained servants , born in his own house , three hundred and eighteen , and ursued them unto Dan .
and he divided himself against them , he and his servants , by night , and smote them , and pursued them unto Hobah , which is on the left hand of Damascus .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought again his brother Lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer , and of the kings that were with him , at the valley of Shaveh , which is the king ’ s dale .
and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was the priest of the most high God .
and he blessed him , and said , Blessed be Abram of the most high God , possessor of heaven and earth :
and blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand . and he gave him tithes of all .
and the king of Sodom said unto Abram , Give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
and Abram said to the king of Sodom , I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD , the most high God , the possessor of heaven and earth ,
that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet , and that I will not take any thing that is thine , lest thou shouldest say , I have made Abram rich :
save only that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men which went with me , Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre ; let them take their portion .
Chapter 15
after these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision , saying , Fear not , Abram : I am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
and Abram said , Lord GOD , what wilt thou give me , seeing I go childless , and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus ?
and Abram said , Behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the LORD came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
and he believed in the LORD ; and he counted it to him for righteousness .
and he said unto him , I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he said , Lord GOD , whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it ?
and he said unto him , Take me an heifer of three years old , and a she goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtle-dove , and a young pigeon .
and he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases , Abram drove them away .
and when the sun was going down , a deep Sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will I judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full .
and it came to pass , that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold a smoking furnace , and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces .
in the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river Euphrates :
the Kenites , and the Kenizzites , and the Kadmonites ,
and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Rephaims ,
and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Girgashites , and the Jebusites .
Chapter 16
now Sarai Abram ’ s wife bare him no children : and she had an handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
and Sarai said unto Abram , Behold now , the LORD hath restrained me from bearing : I pray thee , go in unto my maid ; it may be that I may obtain children by her . and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai .
and Sarai Abram ’ s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian , after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife .
and he went in unto Hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
and Sarai said unto Abram , My wrong be upon thee : I have given my maid into thy bosom ; and when she saw that she had conceived , I was despised in her eyes : the LORD judge between me and thee .
but Abram said unto Sarai , Behold , thy maid is in thy hand ; do to her as it pleaseth thee . and when Sarai dealt hardly with her , she fled from her face .
and the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Shur .
and he said , Hagar , Sarai ’ s maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ? and she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
and the angel of the LORD said unto her , Return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands .
and the angel of the LORD said unto her , I will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
and the angel of the LORD said unto her , Behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction .
and he will be a wild man ; his hand will be against every man , and every man ’ s hand against him ; and he shali dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
and she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her , Thou God seest me : for she said , Have I also here looked after him that seeth me ?
Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi ; behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered .
and Hagar bare Abram a son : and Abram called his son ’ s name , which Hagar bare , Ishmael .
and Abram was fourscore and six years old , when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram .
Chapter 17
and when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the LORD appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
2 , And I will make my covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
and Abram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying ,
as for me , behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations .
neither shall thy name any more be called Abram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
and I will make thee exceeding fruitful , and I will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
and God said unto Abraham , Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore , thou , and thy seed after thee in their generations .
this is my covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and thy seed after thee ; Every man child among you shall be circumcised .
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you .
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
he that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circumcised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised , that soul shall be cut off from his people ; he hath broken my covenant .
and God said unto Abraham , As for Sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name Sarai , but Sarah shall her name be .
and I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and Abraham said unto God , O that Ishmael might live before thee !
and God said , Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him .
and as for Ishmael , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a reat nation .
but my covenant will I establish with Isaac , which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and he left off talking with him , and God went up from Abraham .
and Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham ’ s house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
and Abraham was ninety years old and nine , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
and Ishmael his son was thirteen years old , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
in the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised , and Ishmael his son .
and all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
Chapter 18
and the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself toward the ground ,
and said , My Lord , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and &#93; will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , So do , as thou hast said .
and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah , and said , Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes upon the hearth .
and Abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and gave it unto a young man , and he hasted to dress it .
and he took butter , and milk , and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they did eat .
and they said unto him , Where is Sarah thy wife ? and he said , Behold , in the tent .
and he said , I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life ; and , lo , Sarah thy wife shall have a son . and Sarah heard if in the tent door , which was behind him .
now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
therefore Sarah laughed within herself , saying , After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure , my lord being old also ?
and the LORD said unto Abraham , Wherefore did Sarah laugh , saying , Shall I of a surety bear a child , which am old ?
is any thing too hard for the LORD ? at the time appointed I will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son .
then Sarah denied , saying , I laughed not ; for she was afraid . and he said , Nay ; but thou didst laugh .
and the men rose up from thence , and looked toward Sodom : and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
and the LORD said , Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do ;
seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
for I know him , that he will command his children and his household after him , and they shall keep the way of the LORD , to do justice and judgment ; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him .
and the LORD said , Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ;
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
and the men turned their faces from thence , and went toward Sodom : but Abraham stood yet before the LORD .
23 . and Abraham drew near , and said , Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ?
that be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous with the wicked : and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from thee : shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ?
and the LORD said , If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sakes .
and Abraham answered and said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord , which am but dust and ashes :
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ? and he said , If I find there forty and five , I will not destroy it .
and he spake unto him yet again , and said , Peradventure there shall be forty found there . and he said , I will not do it for forty ’ s sake .
and he said unto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : peradventure there shall thirty be found there . and he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
and he said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord : peradventure there shall be twenty found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for twenty ’ s sake .
and he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : peradventure ten shall be found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for ten ’ s sake .
and the LORD went his way , as soon as he had left communing with Abraham : and Abraham returned unto his place .
Chapter 19
and there came two angels to Sodom at even ; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom : and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
and he said , Behold now , my lords , turn in , I pray you , into your servant ’ s house , and tarry all night , and wash your feet , and ye shall rise up early , and go on your ways . and they said , Nay ; but we will abide in the street all night .
and he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did bake unleavened bread , and they did eat .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they called unto Lot , and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
and Lot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him ,
and said , I pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
behold now , I have two daughters which have not known man ; let me , I pray you , bring them out unto you , and do ye to them as is good in your eyes : only unto these men do nothing ; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof .
and they said , Stand back . and they said again , This one fellow came in to sojourn , and he will needs be a judge : now will we deal worse with thee , than with them . and they pressed sore upon the man , even Lot , and came near to break the door .
but the men put forth their hand , and pulled Lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wearied themselves to find the door .
and the men said unto Lot , Hast thou here any besides ? son in law , and thy sons , and thy daughters , and whatsoever thou hast in the city , bring them out of this place :
for we will destroy this place , beCause the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD ; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it .
and Lot went out , and spake unto his sons in law , which married his daughters , and said , Up , get you out of this place ; for the LORD will destroy this city . but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law .
and when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying , Arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city .
and while he lingered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the LORD being merciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
and it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
and Lot said unto them , Oh , not so , my Lord :
behold now , thy servant hath found grace in thy sight , and thou hast magnified thy mercy , which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life ; and I cannot escape to the mountain , lest some evil take me , and I die :
behold now , this city is near to flee unto , and it is a little one : Oh , let me escape thither , ( is it not a little one ? ) and my soul shall live .
and he said unto him , See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast spoken .
haste thee , escape thither ; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither . therefore the name of the city was called Zoar .
the sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar .
then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven ;
and he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
and Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD :
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt .
and Lot went up out of Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar : and he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
and the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth :
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
and they made their father drink Wine that night : and the firstborn went in , and lay with her father ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the firstborn said unto the younger , Behold , I lay yesternight with my father : let us make him drink wine this night also ; and go thou in , and lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
and they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father .
and the firstborn bare a son , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name Ben-ammi : the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day ,
Chapter 20
and Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country , and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur , and sojourned in Gerar .
and Abraham said of Sarah his wife , She is my sister : and Abimelech king of Gerar sent , and took Sarah .
but God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , Behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man ’ s wife .
but Abimelech had not come near her : and he said , Lord , wilt thou slay also a righteous nation ?
said he not unto me , She is my sister ? and she , even she herself said , He is my brother : in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this .
and God said unto him in a dream , Yea , I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart ; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me : therefore suffered I thee not to touch her .
now therefore restore the man his wife ; for he is a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shait live : and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that are thine . .
therefore Abimelech Tose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
then Abimelech called Abraham , and said unto him , What hast thou done unto us ? and what have I offended thee , that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done .
and Abimelech said unto Abraham , What sawest thou , that thou hast done this thing ?
and Abraham said , Because I thought , Surely the fear of God is not in this place ; and they will slay me for my wife ’ s sake .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and it came to pass , when God caused me to wander from my father ’ s house , that I said unto her , This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me ; at every place whither we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
and Abimelech took sheep , and oxen , and menservants , and womenservants , and gave them unto Abraham , and restored him Sarah his wife .
and Abimelech said , Behold , my land is before thee : dwell where it pleaseth thee .
and unto Sarah he said , Behold , have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver : behold , he is to thee a covering of the eyes , unto all that are with thee , and with all other : thus she was reproved .
so Abraham prayed unto God : and God healed Abimelech , and his wife , and his maidservants ; and they bare children .
for the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech , because of Sarah Abraham ’ s wife .
Chapter 21
and the LORD visited Sarah as he had said , and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken .
for Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac .
and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old , as God had commanded him .
and Abraham was an hundred years old , when his son Isaac was born unto him .
and Sarah said , God hath made me to laugh , so that all that hear will laugh with me .
and she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should have given children suck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
and the child grew , and was weaned : and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned .
and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , which she had born unto Abraham , mocking .
Wherefore she said unto Abraham , Cast out this bondwoman and her son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac .
and the thing was very grievous in Abraham ’ s sight because of his son .
and God said unto Abraham , Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad , and because of thy bondwoman ; in all that Sarah hath said to thee , hearken unto her voice ; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called .
and also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation , because he is thy seed .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a bottle of water , and gave if unto Hagar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away : and she departed , and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba .
and the water was spent in the bottle , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and wept .
and God heard the voice of the lad ; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven , and said unto her , What aileth thee , Hagar ? fear not ; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold him in thine hand ; for I will make him a great nation .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the lad drink .
and God was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass at that time , that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest :
now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me , nor with my son , nor with my son ’ s son : but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee , thou shalt do unto me , and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned .
and Abraham said , I will swear .
and Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water , which Abimelech ’ s servants had violently taken away .
and Abimelech said , I wot not who hath done this thing : neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard I of it , but to day .
and Abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them unto Abimelech ; and both of them made a covenant .
and Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
and Abimelech said unto Abraham , What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves ?
and he said , For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto me , that I have digged this well .
Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba ; because there they sware both of them .
thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba : then Abimelech rose up , and Phichol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
and Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba , and called there on the name of the LORD , the everlasting God .
and Abraham sojourned in the Philistines ’ land many days .
Chapter 22
and it came to pass after these things , that God did tempt Abraham , and said unto him , Abraham : and he said , Behold , here I am .
and he said , Take now thy son , thine only son Isaac , whom thou jovest , and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
and Abraham said unto his young men , Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you .
and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I , my son . and he said , Behold the fire and the wood : but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
and Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and Abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
and the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven , and said , Abraham , Abraham : and he said , Here am I .
and he said , Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh : as it is said to this day , In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen .
and the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time ,
and said , By myself have I sworn , saith the LORD , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son :
that in blessing I will bless thee , and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven , and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ;
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
so Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba ; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba .
and it came to pass after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , Behold , Milcah , she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor ;
Huz his firstborn , and Buz his brother , and Kemuel the father of Aram ,
and Chesed , and Hazo , and Pildash , and Jidlaph , and Bethuel .
and Bethuel begat Rebekah : these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother .
and his concubine , whose name was Reumah , she bare also Tebah , and Gaham , and Thahash , and Maachah .
Chapter 23
and Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old : these were the years of the life of Sarah .
and Sarah died in Kirjath-arba ; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan : and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah , and to weep for her .
and Abraham stood up from before his dead , and spake unto the sons of Heth , saying ,
I am a Stranger and a sojourner with you : give me a possession of a burying place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight .
and the children of Heth answered Abraham , saying unto him ,
hear us , my lord : thou art a mighty prince among us : in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead ; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre , but that thou mayest bury thy dead .
and Abraham stood up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of Heth .
and he communed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar ,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money a it is worth he shall give it me for a Possession of a buryingplace amongst you .
and Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth : and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
Nay , my lord , hear me : the field give I thee , and the cave that is therein , I give it thee ; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee : bury thy dead .
and Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land .
and he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land , saying , But if thou wilt give it , I pray thee , hear me : I will give thee money for the field ; take it of me , and I will bury my dead there .
and Ephron answered Abraham , saying unto him ,
my lord , hearken unto me : the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver ; what is that betwixt me and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
and Abraham hearkened unto Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of Ephron , which was in Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the field , and the cave which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all the borders round about , were made sure
unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth , before all that went in at the gate of his city .
and after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by tie sons of Heth .
Chapter 24
and Abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things .
2 . and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
and I will make thee swear by the LORD , the God of heaven , and the God of the earth , that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son Isaac .
and the servant said unto him , Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land : must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
and Abraham said unto him , Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
the LORD God of heaven , which took me from my father ’ s house , and from the land of my kindred , and which spake unto me , and that sware unto me , saying , Unto thy seed will I give this land ; he shall send his angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and sware to him concerning that matter .
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
and he said , O LORD God of my master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master Abraham .
behold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water :
and let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom I shall say , Let down thy pitcher , I pray thee , that I may drink ; and she shall say , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac ; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master .
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Rebekah came out , who was born to Bethuel , son of Milcah , the wife of Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother , with her pitcher upon her shoulder .
and the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
and the servant ran to meet her , and said , Let me , I pray thee , drink a little water of thy pitcher .
and she said , Drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , I will draw water for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
and she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
and the man wondering at her held his peace , to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not
and it came to pass , as the camels had done drinking , that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold ;
and said , Whose daughter art thou ? tell me , I pray thee : is there room in thy father ’ s house for us to lodge in ?
and she said unto him , I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , which she bare unto Nahor .
she said moreover unto him , We have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
and the man bowed down his head , and worshipped the LORD .
and he said , Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham , who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth : I being in the way , the LORD led me to the house of my master ’ s brethren .
and the damsel ran , and told them of her mother ’ s house these things .
and Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban : and Laban ran out unto the man , unto the well .
and it came to pass , when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister ’ s hands , and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister , saying , Thus spake the man unto me ; that he came unto the man ; and , behold , he stood by the camels at the well .
and he said , Come in , thou blessed of the LORD ; wherefore standest thou Without ? for I have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
and the man came into the house : and he ungirded his camels , and gave straw and provender for the camels , and Water to wash his feet , and the men ’ s feet that were with him .
and there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , I will not eat , until I have told mine errand . and he said , Speak on .
and he said , lam Abraham ’ s servant .
and the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him flocks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and menservants , and maidservants , and camels , and asses .
and Sarah my master ’ s wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
and my master made me swear , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell :
but thou shalt go unto my father ’ s house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
and I said unto my master , Peradventure the woman will not follow me .
and he said unto me , The LORD , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred , and of my father ’ s house :
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath , when thou comest to my kindred ; and if they give not thee one , thou shalt be clear from my oath .
42 . and I came this day unto the well , and said , O LORD God of my master Abraham , if now thou do prosper my way which I go :
behold , I stand by the well of water ; and it shall come to pass , that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water , and I say to her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water of thy pitcher to drink ;
and she say to me , Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels : jet the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master &apos;s Son .
and before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
and I asked her , and said , Whose daughter art thou ? and she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor ’ s son , whom Milcah bare unto him : and I put the earring upon her face , and the bracelets upon her hands .
and I bowed down my head , and worshipped the LORD , and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master ’ s brother ’ s daughter unto his son .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
then Laban and Bethuel answered and said , The thing proceedeth from the LORD : we cannot speak unto thee bad or good .
behold , Rebekah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be thy master ’ s son ’ s wife , as the LORD hath spoken .
and it came to pass , that , when Abraham ’ s servant heard their words , he worshipped the LORD , bowing himself to the earth .
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they did eat and drink , he and the men that were with him , and tarried all night ; and they rose up in the morning , and he said , Send me away unto my master .
and her brother and her mother said , Let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and he said unto them , Hinder me not , seeing the LORD hath prospered my way ; send me away that I may go to my master .
and they said , We will call the damsel , and enquire at her mouth .
and they called Rebekah , and said unto her , Wilt thou go with this man ? and she said , I will go .
and they sent away Rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and Abraham ’ s servant , and his men .
and they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and Rebekah arose , and her damsels , and they rode upon the camels , and followed the man : and the servant took Rebekah , and went his way .
and Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi ; for he dwelt in the south country .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the camels were coming .
and Rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she lighted off the camel .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a vail , and covered herself .
and the servant told Isaac all things that he had done .
and Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah ’ s tent , and took Rebekah , and she became his wife ; and he loved her : and Isaac was comforted after his mother ’ s death .
Chapter 25
then again Abraham took a wife , and her name was Keturah .
and she bare him Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah .
and Jokshan begat Sheba , and Dedan . and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim , and Letushim , and Leummim .
and the sons of Midian ; Ephah , and Epher , and Hanoch , and Abida , and Eldaah . all these were the children of Keturah .
and Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac .
but unto the sons of the concubines , which Abraham had , Abraham gave gifts , and sent them away from Isaac his son , while he yet lived , eastward , unto the east country .
and these are the days of the years of Abraham ’ s life which he lived , an hundred threescore and fifteen years .
then Abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which is before Mamre ;
the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth : there was Abraham buried , and Sarah his wife .
and it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi .
now these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah ’ s handmaid , bare unto Abraham :
and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael , by their names , according to their generations : the firstborn of Ishmael , Nebajoth ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
and Mishma , and Dumah , and Massa ,
Hadar , and Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah :
these are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , by their towns , and by their castles ; twelve princes according to their nations .
and these are the years of the life of Ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
and they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur , that is before Egypt , as thou goest toward Assyria : and he died in the presence of all his brethren .
and these are the generations of Isaac , Abraham ’ s son : Abraham begat Isaac :
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
and Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife , because she was barren : and the LORD was intreated of him , and Rebekah his wife conceived .
and the children struggled together within her ; and she said , If it be so , why am I thus ? and she went to enquire of the LORD .
and the LORD said unto her , Two nations are in thy womb , and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels ; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people ; and the elder shall serve the younger .
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and the first came out red , all over like an hairy garment ; and they called his name Esau .
and after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on Esau ’ s heel ; and his name was called Jacob : and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them .
and the boys grew : and Esau was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
and Isaac loved Esau , because he did eat of his venison : but Rebekah loved Jacob .
and Jacob sod pottage : and Esau came from the field , and he was faint :
and Esau said to Jacob , Feed me , I ray thee , with that same red pottage ; for I am faint : therefore was his name called Edom .
and Jacob said , Sell me this day thy birthright .
and Esau said , Behold , I am at the point to die : and what profit shall this birthright do to me ?
and Jacob said , Swear to me this day ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto Jacob .
then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus Esau despised his birthright .
Chapter 26
and there was a famine in the land , beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . and Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar .
and the LORD appeared unto him , and said , Go not down into Egypt ; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of :
sojourn in this land , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father ;
and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven , and will give unto thy seed all these countries ; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ;
because that Abraham obeyed my voice , and kept my charge , my commandments , my statutes , and my laws .
and Isaac dwelt in Gerar :
and the men of the place asked him of his wife ; and he said , She is my sister : for he feared to say , She is my wife ; lest , said he , the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah ; because she was fair to look upon .
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife .
and Abimelech called Isaac , and said , Behold , of a surety she is thy wife : and how saidst thou , She is my sister ? and Isaac said unto him , Because I said , Lest I die for her .
and Abimelech said , What is this thou hast done unto us ? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife , and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us .
and Abimelech charged all his people , saying , He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death .
then Isaac sowed in that land , and received in the same year an hundredfold : and the LORD blessed him .
and the man waxed great , and went forward , and grew until he became very great :
for he had possession of flocks , and possession of herds , and great store of servants : and the Philistines envied him .
for all the wells which his father ’ s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and Abimelech said unto Isaac , Go from us ; for thou art much mightier than we .
and Isaac departed thence , and itched his tent in the valley of Gerar , and dwelt there .
and Isaac digged again the wells of water , which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father ; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
and Isaac ’ s servants digged in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
and the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac ’ s herdmen , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well Esek ; because they strove with him .
and they digged another well , and strove for that also : and he called the name of it Sitnah .
and he removed from thence , and digged another well ; and for that they strove not : and he called the name of it Rehoboth ; and he said , For now the LORD hath made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
and he went up from thence to Beer-sheba .
and the LORD appeared unto him same night , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father : fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham ’ s sake .
and he builded an altar there , and called upon the name of the LORD , and pitched his tent there : and there Isaac ’ s servants digged a well .
then Abimelech went to him from Gerar , and Ahuzzath one of his friends , and Phichol the chief captain of his army .
and Isaac said unto them , Wherefore come ye to me , seeing ye hate me , and have sent me away from you ?
and they said , We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee : and we said , Let there be now an oath betwixt us , even betwixt us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wilt do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and he made them a feast , and they did eat and drink .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac ’ s servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had digged , and said unto him , We have found water .
and he called it Shebah : therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day .
and Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite :
which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah .
Chapter 27
and it came to pass , that when Isaac was old , and his eyes were dim , so that he could not see , he called Esau his eldest son , and said unto him , My son : and he said unto him , Behold , here am I .
and he said , Behold now , lam old , I know not the day of my death :
now therefore take , I pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me some venison ;
and make me savoury meat , such as I love , and bring if to me , that I may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before I die .
and Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son . and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
and Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son , saying , Behold , I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother , saying ,
bring me venison , and make me savoury meat , that I may eat , and bless thee before the LORD before my death .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee .
go now to the flock , and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father , such as he loveth :
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
and Jacob said to Rebekah his mother , Behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man :
my father peradventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon Me , and not a blessing .
and his mother said unto him , Upon me be thy curse , my son : only Obey my voice , and go fetch me them .
and he went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made savoury meat , such as his father loved .
and Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau , which were with her in the house , and put them upon Jacob her younger son :
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his neck :
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and he came unto his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I ; who art thou , my son ?
and Jacob said unto his father , IL am Esau thy firstborn ; I have done according as thou badest me : arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Because the LORD thy God brought it to me .
and Isaac said unto Jacob , Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son Esau or not .
and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob ’ s voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
and he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother Esau ’ s hands : so he blessed him .
and he said , Art thou my very son Esau ? and he said , I am .
and he said , Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son ’ s venison , that my soul may bless thee . and he brought it near to him , and he did eat : and he brought him wine , and he drank .
and his father Isaac said unto him , Come near now , and kiss me , my son .
and he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment. and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed :
therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven , and the fatness of the earth , and plenty of corn and wine :
let people serve thee , and nations bow down to thee : be lord over thy brethren , and let thy mother ’ s sons bow down to thee : cursed be every one that curseth thee , and blessed be he that blesseth thee .
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
and he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son ’ s venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and Isaac his father said unto him , Who art thou ? and he said , I am thy son , thy firstborn Esau .
and Isaac trembled very exceedingly , and said , Who ? where is he that hath taken venison , and brought it me , and I have eaten of all before thou camest , and have blessed him ? yea , and he shall be blessed .
and when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
and he said , Thy brother came with subtilty , and hath taken away thy blessing .
and he said , Is not he rightly named Jacob ? for he hath supplanted Mme these two times : he took away my birthright ; and , behold , now he hath taken away my blessing . and he said , Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ?
and Isaac answered and said unto Esau , Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
and Esau said unto his father , Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . and Esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
and Isaac his father answered and said unto him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth , and of the dew of heaven from above ;
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion , that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck .
and Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him : and Esau said in his heart , The days of mourning for my father are at hand ; then will I slay my brother Jacob .
and these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , Behold , thy brother Esau , as touching thee , doth comfort himself , purposing to kill thee .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran ;
and tarry with him a few days , until thy brother ’ s fury turn away ,
until thy brother ’ s anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast done to him : then I will send , and fetch thee from thence : why should I be deprived also of you both in one day ?
and Rebekah said to Isaac , Jam weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
Chapter 28
and Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
arise , go to Padan-aram , to the house of Bethuel thy mother ’ s father ; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother ’ s brother .
and God Almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ;
and give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham .
and Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban , son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebekah , Jacob ’ s and Esau ’ s mother .
when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob , and sent him away to Padan-aram , to take him a wife from thence ; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan ;
and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Padan-aram ;
and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father ;
then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham ’ s son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
and Jacob went out from Beersheba , and went toward Haran .
and he lighted upon a certain Place , and tarried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and he dreamed , and behold a ladder set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to heaven : and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it .
and , behold , the LORD stood above it , and said , I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed ;
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
and , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of .
and Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , Surely the LORD is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
and Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pillows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and he called the name of that place Beth-el : but the name of that city was called Luz at the first .
and Jacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and raiment to put on ,
so that I come again to my father ’ s house in peace ; then shall the LORD be my God :
and this stone , which I have set for a pillar , shall be God ’ s house : and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee .
Chapter 29
then Jacob went on his journey , and came into the land of the people of the east .
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three flocks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks : and a great stone was upon the well ’ s mouth .
and thither were all the flocks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well ’ s mouth , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well ’ s mouth in his place .
and Jacob said unto them , My brethren , whence be ye ? and they said , Of Haran are we .
and he said unto them , Know ye Laban the son of Nahor ? and they said , We know him .
and he said unto them , / s he well ? and they said , He is well : and , behold , Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep .
and he said , Lo , it is yet high day , neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together : water ye the sheep , and go and feed them .
and they said , We cannot , until all the flocks be gathered together , and till they roll the stone from the well ’ s Mouth ; then we water the sheep .
and while he yet spake with them , Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep : for she kept them .
and it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother ’ s brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother ’ s brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well ’ s mouth , and watered the flock of Laban his mother ’ s brother .
and Jacob kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
and Jacob told Rachel that he was her father ’ s brother , and that he was Rebekah ’ s son : and she ran and told her father .
and it came to pass , when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister ’ s son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Laban all these things .
and Laban said to him , Surely thou art my bone and my flesh . and he abode with him the space of a month .
and Laban said unto Jacob , Because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought ? tell me , what shall thy wages be ?
and Laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was Leah , and the name of the younger was Rachel .
Leah was tender eyed ; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured .
and Jacob loved Rachel ; and said , I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter .
and Laban said , / t is better that I give her to thee , than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
and Jacob served seven years for Rachel ; and they seemed unto him but a few days , for the love he had to her .
and Jacob said unto Laban , Give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in unto her .
and Laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid .
and it came to pass , that in the morning , behold , it was Leah : and he said to Laban , What is this thou hast done unto me ? did not I serve with thee for Rachel ? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me ? ;
and Laban said , It must not be so done in our country , to give the younger before the firstborn .
fulfil her week , and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years .
and Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also .
and Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid .
and he went in also unto Rachel , and he loved also Rachel more than Leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
and when the LORD saw that Leah was hated , he opened her womb : but Rachel was barren .
and Leah conceived , and bare a son , and she called his name Reuben : for she said , Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love me .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Simeon .
and she conceived again , and bare 4son ; and said , Now this time will my husband be joined unto me , because I have born him three sons : therefore was his name called Levi .
and she conceived again , and bare a son : and she said , Now will I praise the LORD : therefore she called his name Judah ; and left bearing .
Chapter 30
and when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children , Rachel envied her sister ; and said unto Jacob , Give me children , or else I die .
and Jacob ’ s anger was kindled against Rachel : and he said , Am I in God ’ s stead , who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb ?
and she said , Behold my maid Bilhah , go in unto her ; and she shall bear upon my knees , that I may also have children by her .
and she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife : and Jacob went in unto her .
and Bilhah conceived , and bare Jacob a son .
and Rachel said , God hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice , and hath given me a son : therefore called she his name Dan .
and Bilhah Rachel ’ s maid conceived again , and bare Jacob a second son .
and Rachel said , With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister , and I have prevailed : and she called his name Naphtali .
when Leah saw that she had left bearing , she took Zilpah her maid , and gave her Jacob to wife .
and Zilpah Leah ’ s maid bare Jacob a son .
and Leah said , A troop cometh : and she called his name Gad .
and Zilpah Leah ’ s maid bare Jacob a second son .
and Leah said , Happy am I , for the daughters will call me blessed : and she called his name Asher .
and Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest , and found mandrakes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Leah . then Rachel said to Leah , Give me , I pray thee , of thy son ’ s mandrakes .
and she said unto her , Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband ? and wouldest thou take away my son ’ s mandrakes also ? and Rachel said , Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son ’ s mandrakes .
and Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Leah went out to meet him , and said , Thou must come in unto me ; for surely I have hired thee with my son ’ s mandrakes . and he lay with her that night .
and God hearkened unto Leah , and she conceived , and bare Jacob the fifth son .
and Leah said , God hath given me my hire , because I have given my maiden to my husband : and she called his name Issachar .
and Leah conceived again , and bare Jacob the sixth son .
and Leah said , God hath endued me with a good dowry ; now will my husband dwell with me , because I have born him six sons : and she called his name Zebulun .
and afterwards she bare a daughter , and called her name Dinah .
and God remembered Rachel , and God hearkened to her , and opened her womb .
and she conceived , and bare a son ; and said , God hath taken away my reproach :
and she called his name Joseph ; and said , The LORD shall add to me another son .
and it came to pass , when Rachel had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Laban , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
give me my wives and my children , for whom I have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service which I have done thee .
and Laban said unto him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in thine eyes , tarry : for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake .
and he said , Appoint me thy wages , and I will give it .
and he said unto him , Thou knowest how I have served thee , and how thy cattle was with me .
for it was little which thou hadst before I came , and it is now increased unto a multitude ; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming : and now when shall I provide for mine own house also ?
and he said , What shall I give thee ? and Jacob said , Thou shalt not give me any thing : if thou wilt do this thing for me , I will again feed and keep thy flock :
I will pass through all thy flock to day , removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and speckled among the goats : and of such shall be my hire .
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come , when it shall come for my hire before thy face : every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats , and brown among the sheep , that shall be counted stolen with me .
and Laban said , Behold , I would it might be according to thy word .
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and he set three days ’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob : and Jacob fed the rest of Laban ’ s flocks .
and Jacob took him rods of green poplar , and of the hazel and chesnut tree ; and pilled white strakes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks.came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and the flocks conceived before the rods , and brought forth cattle ringstraked , speckled , and spotted .
and Jacob did separate the lambs , and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; and he put his own flocks by themselves , and put them not unto Laban ’ s cattle .
and it came to pass , whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters , that they might conceive among the rods .
but when the cattle were feeble , he put them not in : so the feebler were Laban ’ s , and the stronger Jacob ’ s .
and the man increased exceedingly , and had much cattle , and maidservants , and menservants , and camels , and asses .
Chapter 31
and he heard the words of Laban ’ s sons , saying , Jacob hath taken away all that was our father ’ s ; and of that which was our father ’ s hath he gotten all this glory .
and Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban , and , behold , it was not toward him as before .
and the LORD said unto Jacob , Return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and I will be with thee .
and Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock ,
and said unto them , I see your father ’ s countenance , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father hath been with me .
and ye know that with all my power I have served your father .
and your father hath deceived me , and changed my wages ten times ; but God suffered him not to hurt me .
if he said thus , The speckled shall be thy wages ; then all the cattle bare speckled : and if he said thus , The ringstraked shall be thy hire ; then bare all the cattle ringstraked .
thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father , and given them to me .
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and , behold , the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked , speckled , and grisled .
and the angel of God spake unto me in a dream , saying , Jacob : and I said , Here am I .
and he said , Lift up now thine eyes , and see , all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked , speckled , and grisled : for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee .
I am the God of Beth-el , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
and Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him , Js there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father ’ s house ?
are we not counted of him strangers ? for he hath sold us , and hath quite devoured also our money .
for all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our children ’ s : now then , whatsoever God hath said unto thee , do .
then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon camels ;
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Padan-aram , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
and Laban went to shear his sheep : and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father ’ s .
and Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
Sohe fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount Gilead .
22 , And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled .
and he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ’ journey ; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead .
and God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night , and said unto him , Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
then Laban overtook Jacob . now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount : and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead .
and Laban said to Jacob , What hast thou done , that thou hast stolen away unawares to me , and carried away my daughters , as captives taken with the sword ?
Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly , and steal away from me ; and didst not tell me , that I might have sent thee away with mirth , and with songs , with tabret , and with harp ?
and hast not suffered me to kiss My sons and my daughters ? thou hast Now done foolishly in so doing .
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight , saying , Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
and now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father ’ s house , yer wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
and Jacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me , and take it to thee . for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them .
and Laban went into Jacob ’ s tent , and into Leah ’ s tent , and into the two maidservants ’ tents ; but he found them not . then went he out of Leah ’ s tent , and entered into Rachel ’ s tent .
now Rachel had taken the images , and put them in the camel ’ s furniture , and sat upon them . and Laban searched all the tent , but found them not .
and she said to her father , Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee ; for the custom of women is upon me . and he searched , but found not the images .
and Jacob was wroth , and chode with Laban : and Jacob answered and said to Laban , What is my trespass ? what is my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff , what hast thou found of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt us both .
this twenty years have I been with thee ; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
thus I was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
thus have I been twenty years in thy house ; Iserved thee fourteen years for thy two daughters , and six years for thy cattle : and thou hast changed my wages ten times .
except the God of my father , the God of Abraham , and the fear of Isaac , had been with me , surely thou hadst sent me away now empty . God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands , and rebuked thee yesternight .
and Laban answered and said unto Jacob , These daughters are my daughters , and these children are my children , and these cattle are my cattle , and all that thou seest is mine : and what can I do this day unto these my daughters , or unto their children which they have born ?
now therefore come thou , let us make a covenant , I and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
and Jacob took a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
and Jacob said unto his brethren , Gather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
and Laban called it Jegarsahadutha : but Jacob called it Galeed .
and Laban said , This heap is a witness between me and thee this day . therefore was the name of it called Galeed ;
and Mizpah ; for he said , The LORD watch between me and thee , when we are absent one from another .
if thou shalt afflict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters , no man is with us ; see , God is witness betwixt me and thee .
and Laban said to Jacob , Behold this heap , and behold this pillar , which I have cast betwixt me and thee ;
this heap be witness , and this pillar be witness , that I will not pass over this heap to thee , and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me , for harm .
the God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge betwixt us . and Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
and early in the morning Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them : and Laban departed , and returned unto his place .
Chapter 32
and Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
and when Jacob saw them , he said , This is God ’ s host : and he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
and Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir , the country of Edom .
and he commanded them , saying , Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau ; Thy servant Jacob saith thus , I have sojourned with Laban , and stayed there until now :
and I have oxen , and asses , flocks , and menservants , and womenservants : and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find grace in thy sight .
and the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , We came to thy brother Esau , and also he cometh to meet thee , and four hundred men with him .
then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the flocks , and herds , and the camels , into two bands ;
and said , If Esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
and Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which saidst unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee :
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto thy servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau : for I fear him , lest he will come and smite me , and the mother with the children .
and thou saidst , I will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which cannot be numbered for multitude .
and he lodged there that same night ; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother ;
two hundred she goats , and twenty he goats , two hundred ewes , and twenty rams ,
thirty milch camels with their colts , forty kine , and ten bulls , twenty she asses , and ten foals .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
and he commanded the foremost , saying , When Esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , saying , Whose art thou ? and whither goest thou ? and whose are these before thee ?
then thou shalt say , They be thy servant Jacob ’ s ; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau : and , behold , also he is behind us .
and so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau , when ye find him .
and say ye moreover , Behold , thy servant Jacob is behind us . for he said , I will appease him with the present that goeth before me , and afterward I will see his face ; peradventure he will accept of me .
so went the present over before him : and himself lodged that night in the company .
and he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two womenservants , and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford Jabbok .
and he took them , and sent them over the brook , and sent over that he had .
and Jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of J acob ’ s thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
and he said , Let me go , for the day breaketh . and he said , I will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
and he said unto him , What is thy name ? and he said , Jacob .
and he said , Thy name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed .
and Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . and he said , Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name ? and he blessed him there .
and Jacob called the name of the lace Peniel : for I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved .
and as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him , and he halted upon his thigh . ;
therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank , which is upon the hollow of the thigh , unto this day : because he touched the hollow of Jacob ’ s thigh in the sinew that shrank .
Chapter 33
and Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Esau came , and with him four hundred men . and he divided the children unto Leah , and unto Rachel , and unto the two handmaids .
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost , and Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Joseph hindermost .
and he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and Esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him : and they wept .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw the women and the children ; and said , Who are those with thee ? and he said , The children which God hath graciously given thy servant .
then the handmaidens came near , they and their children , and they bowed themselves .
and Leah also with her children came near , and bowed themselves : and after came Joseph near and Rachel , and they bowed themselves .
and he said , What meanest thou by all this drove which I met ? and he said , These are to find grace in the sight of my lord .
and Esau said , I have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thyself .
and Jacob said , Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because God hath dealt graciously with me , and because I have enough . and he urged him , and he took it .
and he said , Let us take our journey , and let us go , and I will go before thee .
and he said unto him , My lord knoweth that the children are tender , and the flocks and herds with young are with me : and if men should overdrive them one day , all the flock will die .
let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Seir .
and Esau said , Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me . and he said , What needeth it ? let me find grace in the sight of my lord .
so Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir .
and Jacob journeyed to Succoth , and built him an house , and made booths for his cattle : therefore the name of the place is called Succoth .
and Jacob came to Shalem , a city of Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padanaram ; and pitched his tent before the city .
and he bought a parcel of a field , where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Hamor , Shechem ’ s father , for an hundred pieces of money .
and he erected there an altar , and called it El-elohe-Israel .
Chapter 34
and Dinah the daughter of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
and when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite , prince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and defiled her .
and his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
and Shechem spake unto his father Hamor , saying , Get me this damsel to wife .
and Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter : now his sons were with his cattle in the field : and Jacob held his peace until they were come .
and Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him .
and the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it : and the men were grieved , and they were very wroth , because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob ’ s daughter ; which thing ought not to be done .
and Hamor communed with them , saying , The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter : I pray you give her him to wife .
and make ye marriages with us , and give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
and ye shall dwell with us : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possessions therein .
and Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , Let me find grace in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me I will give .
ask me never so much dowry and gift , and I will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the damsel to wife .
and the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully , and said , because he had defiled Dinah their sister :
and they said unto them , We cannot do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us :
but in this will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be , that every male of you be circumcised ;
then will we give our daughters unto you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
Butif ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and their words pleased Hamor , and Shechem Hamor ’ s son .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob ’ s daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
and Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
these men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us , to be one people , if every male among us be circumcised , as they are circumcised .
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours ? only let us consent unto them , and they will dwell with us .
and unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circumcised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah ’ s brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and slew all the males .
and they slew Hamorand Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem ’ s house , and went out .
the sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and spoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
they took their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ,
and all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wives took they captive , and spoiled even all that was in the house .
and Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land , among the Canaanites and the Perizzites : and I being few in number , they shall gather themselves together against me , and slay me ; and I shall be destroyed , I and my house .
and they said , Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot ?
Chapter 35
and God said unto Jacob , Arise , go up to Beth-el , and dwell there : and make there an altar unto God , that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother .
then Jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments :
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand , and all their earrings which were in their ears ; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem .
and they journeyed : and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob .
so Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Beth-el , he and all the people that were with him .
and he built there an altar , and called the place El-Beth-el : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
but Deborah Rebekah ’ s nurse died , and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak : and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth .
and God appeared unto Jacob again , when he came out of Padanaram , and blessed him .
and God said unto him , Thy name is Jacob : thy name shall not be called any more Jacob , but Israel shall be thy name : and he called his name Israel .
and God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins ;
and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to thy seed after thee will I give the land .
and God went up from him in the Jace where he talked with him .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
and Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him , Bethel .
and they journeyed from Beth-el ; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath : and Rachel travailed , and she had hard labour .
and it came to pass , when she was in hard labour , that the midwife said unto her , Fear not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and it came to pass , as her soul was in departing , ( for she died ) that she called his name Ben-oni : but his father called him Benjamin .
and Rachel died , and was buried in the way to Ephrath , which is Bethlehem .
and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rachel ’ s grave unto this day .
and Israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar .
and it came to pass , when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father ’ s concubine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
the sons of Leah ; Reuben , Jacob ’ s firstborn , and Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Zebulun :
the sons of Rachel ; Joseph , and Benjamin :
and the sons of Bilhah , Rachel ’ s handmaid ; Dan , and Naphtali :
and the sons of Zilpah , Leah ’ s handmaid ; Gad , and Asher : these are the sons of Jacob , which were born to im in Padan-aram .
and Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre , unto the city of Arbah , which is Hebron , where Abraham and Isaac sojourned .
and the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years .
and Isaac gave up the ghost , and died , and was gathered unto his people , being old and full of days : and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
Chapter 36
now these are the generations of Esau , who is Edom .
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ;
and Bashemath Ishmael ’ s daughter , sister of Nebajoth .
and Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz ; and Bashemath bare Reuel ;
and Aholibamah bare Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah : these are the sons of Esau , which were born unto him in the land of Canaan .
and Esau took his wives , and his sons , and his daughters , and all the persons of his house , and his cattle , and all his beasts , and all his substance , which he had got in the land of Canaan ; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob .
for their riches were more than that they might dwell together ; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle .
thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir : Esau is Edom .
and these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir :
these are the names of Esau ’ s sons ; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau , Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau .
and the sons of Eliphaz were Teman , Omar , Zepho , and Gatam , and Kenaz .
and Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau ’ s son ; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek : these were the sons of Adah Esau ’ s wife .
and these are the sons of Reuel ; Nahath , and Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah : these were the sons of Bashemath Esau ’ s wife .
and these were the sons of Aholibamah , the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon , Esau ’ s wife : and she bare to Esau Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah .
these were dukes of the sons of Esau : the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau ; duke Teman , duke Omar , duke Zepho , duke Kenaz ,
duke Korah , duke Gatam , and duke Amalek : these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom ; these were the sons of Adah .
and these are the sons of Reuel Esau ’ s son ; duke Nahath , duke Zerah , duke Shammah , duke Mizzah : these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom ; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau ’ s wife .
and these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau ’ s wife ; duke Jeush , duke Jaalam , duke Korah : these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah , Esau ’ s wife .
these are the sons of Esau , who is Edom , and these are their dukes .
these are the sons of Seir the Horite , who inhabited the land ; Lotan , and Shobal , and Zibeon , and Anah ,
and Dishon , and Ezer , and Dishan : these are the dukes of the Horites , the children of Seir in the land of Edom .
and the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam ; and Lotan ’ s sister was Timna .
and the children of Shobal were these ; Alvan , and Manahath , and Ebal , Shepho , and Onam .
and these are the children of Zibeon ; both Ajah , and Anah : this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness , as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father .
and the children of Anah were these ; Dishon , and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah .
and these are the children of Dishon ; Hemdan , and Eshban , and Ithran , and Cheran .
the children of Ezer are these ; Bilhan , and Zaavan , and Akan .
the children of Dishan are these ; Uz , and Aran .
these are the dukes that came of the Horites ; duke Lotan , duke Shobal , duke Zibeon , duke Anah ,
duke Dishon , duke Ezer , duke Dishan : these are the dukes that came of Hori , among their dukes in the land of Seir .
and these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom , before there reigned any king over the children of Israel .
and Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom : and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
and Bela died , and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead .
and Jobab died , and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead .
and Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
and Hadad died , and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead .
and Samlah died , and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead .
and Saul died , and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead .
and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died , and Hadar reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Pau ; and his wife ’ s name was Mehetabel , the daughter of Matred , the daughter of Mezahab .
and these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; duke Timnah , duke Alvah , duke Jetheth ,
duke Aholibamah , duke Elah , duke Pinon ,
duke Kenaz , duke Teman , duke Mibzar ,
duke Magdiel , duke Iram : these be the dukes of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession : he is Esau the father of the Edomites .
Chapter 37
and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger , in the land of Canaan .
these are the generations of Jacob . Joseph , being seventeen years old , was feeding the flock with his brethren ; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah , and with the sons of Zilpah , his father ’ s wives : and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren , they hated him , and could not speak peaceably unto him .
and Joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it his brethren : and they hated him yet the more .
and he said unto them , Hear , I pray you , this dream which I have dreamed :
for , behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about , and made obeisance to my sheaf .
and his brethren said to him , Shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams , and for his words .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Behold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
and he told it to his father , and to his brethren : and his father rebuked him , and said unto him , What is this dream that thou hast dreamed ? shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
and his brethren envied him ; but his father observed the saying .
and his brethren went to feed their father ’ s flock in Shechem .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem ? come , and I will send thee unto them . and he said to him , Here am I .
and he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the flocks ; and bring me word again . so he sent him out of the vale of Hebron , and he came to Shechem .
and acertain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
and he said , I seek my brethren : tell me , I pray thee , where they feed their flocks .
and the man said , They are departed hence ; for I heard them say , Let us go to Dothan . and Joseph went after his brethren , and found them in Dothan . .
and when they saw him afar off , even before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
and they said one to another , Behold , this dreamer cometh .
come now therefore , and let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath devoured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
22 , And Reuben said unto them , Shed no blood , but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness , and lay no hand upon him ; that he might rid him out of their hands , to deliver him to his father again .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt .
and Judah said unto his brethren , What profit is it if we slay our brother , and conceal his blood ?
come , and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh . and his brethren were content .
then there passed by Midianites Merchantmen ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and Reuben returned unto the pit ; and , behold , Joseph was not in the pit ; and he rent his clothes .
and he returned unto his brethren , and said , The child is not ; and I , whither shall I go ?
and they took Joseph ’ s coat , and killed a kid of the goats , and dipped the coat in the blood ;
and they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought if to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be thy son ’ s coat or no .
and he knew it , and said , It is my son ’ s coat ; an evil beast hath devoured him ; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces .
and Jacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comforted ; and he said , For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning . thus his father wept for him .
and the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh ’ s , and captain of the guard .
Chapter 38
and it came to pass at that time , that Judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she conceived , and bare a son ; and he called his name Er .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and she called his name Onan .
and she yet again conceived , and bare a SON ; and called his name Shelah : and he was at Chezib , when she bare him .
and Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn , whose name was Tamar .
and Er , Judah ’ s firstborn , was wicked in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD slew him .
and Judah said unto Onan , Go in unto thy brother ’ s wife , and marry her , and raise up seed to thy brother .
and Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother ’ s wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and the thing which he did displeased the LORD : Wherefore he slew him also .
then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law , Remain a widow at thy father ’ s house , till Shelah my son be grown : for he said , Lest peradventure he die also , as his brethren did . and Tamar went and dwelt in her father ’ s house .
and in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah ’ s wife died ; and Judah was comforted , and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
and it was told Tamar , saying , Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep .
and she put her widow ’ s garments off from her , and covered her with a vail , and wrapped herself , and sat in an open place , which is by the way to Timnath ; for she saw that Shelah was grown , and she was not given unto him to wife .
when Judah saw her , he thought her to be an harlot ; because she had Covered her face .
and he turned unto her by the way , and said , Go to , I pray thee , let me come in unto thee ; ( for he knew not that she was his daughter in law . ) And she said , What wilt thou give me , that thou mayest come in unto me ?
and he said , I will send thee a kid from the flock . and she said , Wilt thou give me a pledge , till thou send it ?
and he said , What pledge shall I give thee ? and she said , Thy signet , and thy bracelets , and thy staff that is in thine hand . and he gave it her , and came in unto her , and she conceived by him .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite , to receive his pledge from the woman ’ s hand : but he found her not .
then he asked the men of that place , saying , Where is the harlot , that was openly by the way side ? and they said , There was no harlot in this place .
and he returned to Judah , and said , I cannot find her ; and also the men of the place said , that there was no harlot in this place .
and Judah said , Let her take it to her , lest we be shamed : behold , I sent this kid , and thou hast not found her .
and it came to pass about three months after , that it was told Judah , saying , Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot ; and also , behold , she is with child by whoredom . and Judah said , Bring her forth , and let her be burnt .
when she was brought forth , she sent to her father in law , saying , By the man , whose these are , am I with child : and she said , Discern , I pray thee , whose are these , the signet , and bracelets , and staff .
and Judah acknowledged them , and said , She hath been more righteous than I ; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son . and he knew her again no more .
and it came to pass in the time of her travail , that , behold , twins were in her womb .
and it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand : and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first .
and it came to pass , as he drew back his hand , that , behold , his brother came out : and she said , How hast thou broken forth ? this breach be upon thee : therefore his name was called Pharez .
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called Zarah .
Chapter 39
and Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
and the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and his master saw that the LORD was with him , and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
and Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house , and over all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptian ’ s house for Joseph ’ s sake ; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
and he left all that he had in Joseph ’ s hand ; and he knew not ought he had , save the bread which he did eat . and Joseph was a goodly person , and well favoured .
and it came to pass after these things , that his master ’ s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , Lie with me .
but he refused , and said unto his master ’ s wife , Behold , my master wotteth not what is with me in the house , and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand ;
there is none greater in this house than I ; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I do this great wickedness , and sin against God ?
and it came to pass , as she spake to Joseph day by day , that he hearkened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and she caught him by his garment , saying , Lie with me : and he left his garment in her hand , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
that she called unto the men of her house , and spake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice :
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she laid up his garment by her , til his lord came home .
and she spake unto him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mock me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spake unto him , saying , After this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kindled .
and Joseph ’ s master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king ’ s prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
but the LORD was with Joseph , and shewed him mercy , and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph ’ s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the doer of it .
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the LORD was with him , and that which he did , the LORD made it to prosper .
Chapter 40
and it came to pass after these things , that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt .
and Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers , against the chief Of the butlers , and against the chief of the bakers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them , and he served them : and they continued a season in ward .
and they dreamed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
and Joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
and he asked Pharaoh ’ s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord ’ s house , saying , Wherefore look ye so sadly to day ?
and they said unto him , We have dreamed a dream , and there is no interpreter of it . and Joseph said unto them , Do not interpretations belong to God ? tell me them , I pray you .
and the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and in the vine were three branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes :
and Pharaoh ’ s cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh ’ s cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh ’ s hand .
and Joseph said unto him , This is the interpretation of it : the three branches are three days :
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head , and restore thee unto thy place : and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh ’ s cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his butler .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and shew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said unto Joseph , I also was in my dream , and , behold , I had three white baskets on my head :
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
and Joseph answered and said , This is the interpretation thereof : the three baskets are three days :
yet within three days shall Pharaoh liftup thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and it came to pass the third day , which was Pharaoh ’ s birthday , that he made a feast unto all his servants : and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants .
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again ; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh ’ s hand :
but he hanged the chief baker : as Joseph had interpreted to them .
yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph , but forgat him .
Chapter 41
and it came to pass at the end of two full years , that Pharaoh dreamed : and , behold , he stood by the river .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed ; and they fed in a meadow .
and , behold , seven other kine Came up after them out of the river , ill favoured and leanfleshed ; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river .
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine . so Pharaoh awoke .
and he slept and dreamed the second time : and , behold , seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them .
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears . and Pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh , saying , I do remember my faults this day :
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the captain of the guard ’ s house , both me and the chief baker :
and we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and there was there with us a young man , an Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpret .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself , and changed his raiment , and came in Unto Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it : and I have heard say of thee , that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it .
and Joseph answered Pharaoh , saying . it is not in me : God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , In my dream , behold , I stood upon the bank of the river :
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fatfleshed and well favoured ; and they fed in a meadow :
and , behold , seven other kine came up after them , poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed , such as I n all the land of Egypt for badness ;
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine :
Ann they had eaten them up , it could not be known that they had eaten them ; but they were still ill favoured , as at the beginning . so I awoke .
and I saw in my dream , and , behold , seven ears came up in one stalk , full and good .
and , behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them :
and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears : and I told this unto the magicians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
and Joseph said unto Pharaoh , The dream of Pharaoh is one : God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do .
the seven good kine are seven Years ; and the seven good ears are seven years ; the dream is one .
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine .
this is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh : what God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh .
behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt :
and there shall arise after them seven years of famine ; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt ; and the famine shall consume the land ;
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of Egypt .
let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up com under the hand of Pharaoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
and the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
and Pharaoh said unto his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this , there is none so discreet and wise as thou art :
thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my ople be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater than thou .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , See , I have set thee over all the land of Egypt . .
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph ’ s hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had ; and they cried before him , Bow the knee : and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I am Pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt .
and Pharaoh called Joseph ’ s name Zaphnath-paaneah ; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On . and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
and Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls .
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years , which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was round about every city , laid he up in the same .
and Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea , very much , until he left numbering ; for it was without number .
and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him .
and Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh : for God , said he , hath made me forget all my toil , and all my father ’ s house .
and the name of the second called he Ephraim : for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven years of plenteousness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and when all the land of Egypt was famished , the people cried to Pharaoh for bread : and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians , Go unto Joseph ; what he saith to you , do .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the storehouses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt .
and all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn ; because that the famine was so sore in all lands .
Chapter 42
now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt , Jacob said unto his sons , Why do ye look one upon another ?
and he said , Behold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thither , and buy for us from thence ; that we may live , and not die .
and Joseph ’ s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt .
but Benjamin , Joseph ’ s brother , cob sent not with his brethren ; for he said , Lest peradventure mischief befall him .
and the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came : for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
and Joseph was the governor over the land , and he it was that sold to all the people of the land : and Joseph ’ s brethren came , and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth .
and Joseph saw his brethren , and he knew them , but made himself strange unto them , and spake roughly unto them ; and he said unto them , Whence come ye ? and they said , From the land of Canaan to buy food .
and Joseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
and Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them , and said unto them , Ye are spies ; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
and they said unto him , Nay , my lord , but to buy food are thy servants come .
Weare all one man ’ s sons ; we are true men , thy servants are no spies .
and he said unto them , Nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
and they said , Thy servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man inthe land of Canaan ; and , behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not .
and Joseph said unto them , That is it that I spake unto you , saying , Ye are spies :
hereby ye shall be proved : by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except your youngest brother come hither .
send one of you , and let him fetch Your brother , and ye shall be kept in whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies .
and he put them all together into ward three days .
and Joseph said unto them the third day , This do , and live ; for I fear God :
if ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of your houses :
but bring your youngest brother unto me ; so shall your words be verified , and ye shall not die . and they did so .
and they said one to another , We are verily guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the anguish of his soul , when he besought us , and we would not hear ; therefore is this distress come upon us .
and Reuben answered them , saying , Spake I not unto you , saying , Do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also his blood is required .
and they knew not that Joseph understood them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter .
and he turned himself about from them , and wept ; and returned to them again , and communed with them , and took from them Simeon , and bound him before their eyes .
then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn , and to restore every man ’ s money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and they laded their asses with the corn , and departed thence .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack ’ s mouth .
and he said unto his brethren , My money is restored ; and , lo , it is even in sack : and their heart failed them , and they were afraid , saying one to another , What is this that God hath done unto us ?
and they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan , and told him all that befell unto them ; saying ,
the man , who is the lord of the Jand , spake roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
and we said unto him , We are true men ; we are no spies :
we be twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan .
and the man , the lord of the country , said unto us , Hereby shall I know that ye are true men ; leave one of your brethren here with me , and take food for the famine of your households , and be gone :
and bring your youngest brother unto me : then shall I know that ye are no spies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traffick in the land .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man ’ s bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
and Jacob their father said unto them , Me have ye bereaved of my children : Joseph is not , and Simeon is not , and ye will take Benjamin away : all these things are against me .
and Reuben spake unto his father , saying , Slay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
and he said , My son shall not go down with you ; for his brother is dead , and he is left alone : if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
Chapter 43
and the famine was sore in the land .
and it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , Go again , buy us a little food .
and Judah spake unto him , saying , The man did solemnly protest unto us , saying , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
if thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food :
but if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
and Israel said , Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me , as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ?
and they said , The man asked us straitly of our state , and of our kindred , saying , / s your father yet alive ? have ye another brother ? and we told him according to the tenor of these words : could we certainly know that he would say , Bring your brother down ?
and Judah said unto Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
I will be surety for him ; of my hand shalt thou require him : if I bring him not unto thee , and set him before thee , then let me bear the blame for ever :
for except we had lingered , surely now we had returned this second time .
and their father Israel said unto them , If it must be so now , do this ; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels , and carry down the man a present , a little balm , and a little honey , spices , and myrrh , nuts , and almonds :
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks , carry it again in your hand ; peradventure it was an oversight :
take also your brother , and arise , o again unto the man :
and God Almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send away your other brother , and Benjamin . if I be bereaved of my children , I am bereaved .
and the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand , and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
and when Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the ruler of his house , Bring these men home , and slay , and make ready ; for these men shall dine with me at noon .
and the man did as Joseph bade ; and the man brought the men into Joseph ’ s house .
and the men were afraid , because they were brought into Joseph ’ s house ; and they said , Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in ; that he may seek occasion against us , and fall upon us , and take us for bondmen , and our asses .
and they came near to the steward of Joseph ’ s house , and they communed with him at the door of the house ,
and said , O sir , we came indeed down at the first time to buy food :
and it came to pass , when we came fo the inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man ’ s money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food : we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks .
and he said , Peace be to you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father , hath given you treasure in your sacks : I had your money . and he brought Simeon out unto them .
and the man brought the men into Joseph ’ s house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
and they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon : for they heard that they should eat bread there .
and when Joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed themselves to him to the earth .
and he asked them of their welfare , and said , Js your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? / s he yet alive ?
and they answered , Thy servant our father is in good health , he is yet alive . and they bowed down their heads , and made obeisance .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw his brother Benjamin , his mother ’ s son , and said , / s this your younger brother , of whom ye spake unto me ? and he said , God be gracious unto thee , my son .
and Joseph made haste ; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother : and he sought where to weep ; and he entered into his chamber , and wept there .
and he washed his face , and went out , and refrained himself , and said , Set on bread .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews ; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians . .
and they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men marvelled one at another .
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him : but Benjamin ’ s mess was five times so much as any of theirs . and they drank , and were merry with him .
Chapter 44
and he commanded the steward of his house , saying , Fill the men ’ s sacks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man ’ s money in his sack ’ s mouth .
and put my cup , the silver cup , in the sack ’ s mouth of the youngest , and his corn money . and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
and when they were gone out of the city , and not yer far off , Joseph said unto his steward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou dost overtake them , say unto them , Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
is not this it in which my lord drinketh , and whereby indeed he divineth ? ye have done evil in so doing .
and he overtook them , and he spake unto them these same words .
and they said unto him , Wherefore saith my lord these words ? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing :
behold , the money , which we found in our sacks ’ mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan : how then should we steal out of thy lord ’ s house silver or gold ?
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord ’ s bondmen .
and he said , Now also Jet it be according unto your words : he with whom it is found shall be my servant ; and ye shall be blameless .
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground , and opened every man his sack .
and he searched , and began at the eldest , and left at the youngest : and the cup was found in Benjamin ’ s sack .
then they rent their clothes , and laded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
and Judah and his brethren came to Joseph ’ s house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
and Joseph said unto them , What deed is this that ye have done ? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine ?
and Judah said , What shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord ’ s servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
then Judah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord ’ s ears , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as Pharaoh .
my lord asked his servants , saying , Have ye a father , or a brother ?
and we said unto my lord , We ye a father , an old man , and a child f his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him .
and thou saidst unto thy servants , Bring him down unto me , that I may mine eyes upon him .
and we said unto my lord , The lad cannot leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die .
and thou saidst unto thy servants , Except your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
and our father said , Go again , and buy us a little food .
and we said , We cannot go down : if our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down : for we may not see the man ’ s face , except our youngest brother be with us .
and thy servant my father said unto us , Ye know that my wife bare me two sons :
and the one went out from me , and I said , Surely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since :
and if ye take this also from me , and mischief befall him , ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
now therefore when I come to thy Servant my father , and the lad be not with us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad ’ s life ;
it shall come to pass , when he seeth that the lad is not with us , that he will die : and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave .
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father , saying , If I bring him not unto thee , then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever .
now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
for how shall I go up to my father , and the lad be not with me ? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father .
Chapter 45
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and he wept aloud : and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , I am Joseph ; doth my father yet live ? and his brethren could not answer him ; for they were troubled at his presence .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliverance .
so now it was not you that sent me hither , but God : and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
haste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Thus saith thy son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tarry not :
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children ’ s children , and thy flocks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast :
and there will I nourish thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and , behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
and he fell upon his brother Benjamin ’ s neck , and wept ; and Benjamin wept upon his neck .
moreover he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
and the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh ’ s house , saying , Joseph ’ s brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto thy brethren , This do ye ; lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ;
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come ,
also regard not your stuff ; for the 800d of all the land of Egypt is yours .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
and they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father ,
and told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . and Jacob ’ s heart fainted , for he believed them not .
and they told him all the words of Joseph , which he had said unto them : and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him , the spirit of Jacob their father revived :
and Israel said , / t is enough ; Joseph my son is yet alive : I will go and see him before I die .
Chapter 46
and Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Beer-sheba , and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac .
and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night , and said , Jacob , Jacob . and he said , Here am I .
and he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation :
I will go down with thee into Egypt ; and I will also surely bring thee up again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes .
and Jacob rose up from Beersheba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
and they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him :
his sons , and his sons ’ sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ’ daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
and these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob &apos;s firstborn .
and the sons of Reuben ; Hanoch , and Hezron , and Hezron , and Carmi .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman .
and the sons of Levi ; Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
and the sons of Judah ; Er , and Onan , and Shelah , and Pharez , and Zerah : but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan . and the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul .
and the sons of Issachar ; Tola , and Phuvah , and Job and Shimron .
and the sons of Zebulun ; Sered , and Elon , and Jahleel .
these be the sons of Leah , which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram , with his daughter Dinah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
and the sons of Gad ; Ziphion , and Haggi , Shuni , and Ezbon , Eri , and Arodi , and Areli .
and the sons of Asher ; Jimnah , and Ishuah and Isui , and Beriah , and Serah their sister : and the sons of Beriah ; Heber , and Malchiel .
these are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
the sons of Rachel Jacob ’ s wife ; Joseph , and Benjamin .
and unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him .
and the sons of Benjamin were Belah , and Becher , and Ashbel , Gera , and Naaman , Ehi , and Rosh , Muppim , and Huppim , and Ard .
these are the sons of Rachel , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
and the sons of Dan ; Hushim .
and the sons of Naphtali ; Jahzeel , and Guni , and Jezer , and Shillem .
these are the sons of Bilhah , which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter , and she bare these unto Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt , which came out of his loins , besides Jacob ’ s sons ’ wives , all the souls were threescore and six ;
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were threescore and ten .
and he sent Judah before him unto Joseph , to direct his face unto Goshen ; and they came into the land of Goshen .
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Now let me die , since I have seen thy face , because thou art yet alive .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father ’ s house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father ’ s house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ;
and the men are shepherds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have .
and it shall come to pass , when Pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , What is your occupation ?
that ye shall say , Thy servants ’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
Chapter 47
then Joseph came and told Pharaoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Canaan ; and , behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
and he took some of his brethren , even five men , and presented them unto Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh said unto his brethren , What is your occupation ? and they said unto Pharaoh , Thy servants are shepherds , both we , and also our fathers .
they said moreover unto Pharaoh , For to sojourn in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
and Pharaoh spake unto Joseph , Saying , Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee :
the land of Egypt is before thee ; In the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell ; in the land of Goshen let them dwell : and if thou knowest any men of activity among them , then make them rulers over my cattle .
and Joseph brought in Jacob his father , and set him before Pharaoh : and Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh said unto Jacob , How old art thou ?
and Jacob said unto Pharaoh , The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years : few and evil have the days of the years of my life been , and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage .
and Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from before Pharaoh .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and Joseph nourished his father , and his brethren , and all his father ’ s household , with bread , according to their families .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh ’ s house .
and when money failed in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came unto Joseph , and said , Give us bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money faileth .
and Joseph said , Give your cattle ; and I will give you for your cattle , if money fail .
and they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the flocks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for e asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
when that year was ended , they came unto him the second year , and said unto him , We will not hide it from lord , how that our money is spent ; my lord also hath our herds of cattle ; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord , but our bodies , and our lands :
Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes , both we and our land ? buy us and our land for bread , and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh : and give us seed , that we may live , and not die , that the land be not desolate .
and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them : so the land became Pharaoh ’ s .
and as for the people , he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof .
only the land of the priests bought he not ; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh , and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them : Wherefore they sold not their lands .
then Joseph said unto the people , Behold , I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
and it shall come to pass in the Increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh , and four parts shall be your own , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
and they said , Thou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh ’ s servants .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Pharaoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not Pharaoh ’ s .
and Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt , in the country of Goshen ; and they had possessions therein , and grew , and multiplied exceedingly .
and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years : so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years .
and the time drew nigh that Israel must die : and he called his son Joseph , and said unto him , If now I have found grace in thy sight , put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and deal kindly and truly with me ; bury me not , I pray thee , in Egypt :
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and he said , Swear unto me . and he sware unto him . and Israel bowed himself upon the bed ’ s head .
Chapter 48
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , Behold , thy father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
and one told Jacob , and said , Behold , thy son Joseph cometh unto thee : and Israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and Jacob said unto Joseph , God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan , and blessed me ,
and said unto me , Behold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
and now thy two sons , Ephraim dd Manasseh , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Reuben and Simeon , they shall be mine .
and thy issue , which thou begettest after them , shall be thine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
and as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath : and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath ; the same is Beth-lehem .
and Israel beheld Joseph ’ s sons , and said , Who are these ?
and Joseph said unto his father , They are my sons , whom God hath given me in this place . and he said , Bring them , I pray thee , unto me , and I will bless them .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near unto him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
and Israel said unto Joseph , I had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , God hath shewed me also thy seed .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel ’ s left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel ’ s right hand , and brought them near unto him .
and Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid if upon Ephraim ’ s head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh ’ s head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was the firstborn ,
and he blessed Joseph , and said , God , before whom my fathers Abraand Isaac did walk , the God which ed me all my life long unto this day ,
the Angel which redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim , it displeased him : and he held up his father ’ s hand , to remove it from Ephraim ’ s head unto Manasseh ’ s head .
and Joseph said unto his father , Not so , my father : for this is the firstborn ; put thy right hand upon his head .
and his father refused , and said , I know it , my son , I know it : he also shall become a people , and he also shall be great : but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his seed shall become a multitude of nations .
and he blessed them that day , saying , In thee shall Israel bless , saying , God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh : and he set Ephraim before Manasseh .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Behold , I die : but God shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow .
Chapter 49
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
gather yourselves together , and hear , ye sons of Jacob ; and hearken unto Israel your father .
Reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
unstable as water , thou shalt not excel ; because thou wentest up to thy father ’ s bed ; then defiledst thou it : he went up to my couch .
Simeon and Levi are brethren ; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations .
O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and scatter them in Israel .
Judah , thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise : thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies ; thy father ’ s children shall bow down before thee .
Judah is a lion ’ s whelp : from the prey , my son , thou art gone up : he stooped down , he couched as a lion , and as an old lion ; who shall rouse him up ?
the sceptre shall not depart from Judah , nor a lawgiver from between his feet , until Shiloh come ; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be .
binding his foal unto the vine , and his ass ’ s colt unto the choice vine ; he washed his garments in wine , and his clothes in the blood of grapes :
his eyes shall be red with wine , and his teeth white with milk .
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the Sea ; and he shall be for an haven Of ships ; and his border shall be unto Zidon .
Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens :
and he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleasant ; and bowed his shoulder to bear , and became a servant unto tribute .
Dan shall judge his people , as one of the tribes of Israel .
Dan shall be a serpent by the way , an adder in the path , that biteth the horse heels , so that his rider shall fall backward .
I have waited for thy salvation , O LORD .
Gad , a troop shall overcome him : but he shall overcome at the last .
out of Asher his bread shall be fat , and he shall yield royal dainties .
Naphtali is a hind let loose : he giveth goodly words .
Joseph is a fruitful bough , even a fruitful bough by a well ; whose branches run over the wall :
the archers have sorely grieved him , and shot at him , and hated him :
but his bow abode in strength , and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob ; ( from thence is the shepherd , the stone of Israel : )
even by the God of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lieth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills : they shall be on the head of Joseph , and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren . ; ;
Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf : in the morning he shall devour the prey , and at night he shall divide the spoil .
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
and he charged them , and said unto them , I am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is before Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryinglace .
there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife ; and there I buried Leah .
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
Chapter 50
and Joseph fell upon his father ’ s pce. and wept upon him , and kissed im .
and Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father : and the physicians embalmed Israel .
and forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed : and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days .
and when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I have found grace in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
my father made me swear , saying , Lo , I die : in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan , there shalt thou bury me . now therefore let me go up , I pray thee , and bury my father , and I will come again .
and Pharaoh said , Go up , and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father ’ s house : only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
and they came to the threshingfloor of Atad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
and when the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning in the floor of Atad , they said , This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians : Wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim , which is beyond Jordan .
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them :
for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephthe Hittite , before Mamre .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he and his brethren , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
and when Joseph ’ s brethren saw that their father was dead , they said , Joseph will peradventure hate us , and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him .
and they sent a messenger unto Joseph , saying , Thy father did command before he died , saying ,
so shall ye say unto Joseph , Forgive , &#93; pray thee now , the trespass of thy brethren , and their sin ; for they did unto thee evil : and now , we pray thee , forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father . and Joseph wept when they spake unto him .
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , Behold , we be thy servants .
and Joseph said unto them , Fear not : for am I in the place of God ?
but as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : I will nourish you , and your little ones . and he comforted them , and spake kindly unto them .
and Joseph dwelt in Egypt , he , and his father ’ s house : and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years .
and Joseph saw Ephraim ’ s children of the third generation : the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph ’ s knees .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Idie : and God will surely visit you , and ring you out of this land unto the land Which he sware to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones from hence .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ,
Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ,
Dan , and Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
and all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls : for Joseph was in Egypt already .
and Joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
and the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
now there arose up a new king over Egypt , which knew not Joseph .
and he said unto his people , Behold , the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we :
come on , let us deal wisely with them ; lest they multiply , and it come to pass , that , when there falleth out any war , they join also unto our enemies , and fight against us , and so get them up out of the land .
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens . and they built for Pharaoh treasure cities , Pithom and Raamses .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew . and they were grieved because of the children of Israel .
and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour :
and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage , in morter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , wherein they made them serve , was with rigour .
and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah :
and he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
but the midwives feared God , and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them , but saved the men children alive .
and the king of Egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
and the midwives said unto Pharaoh , Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women ; for they are lively , and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them .
therefore God dealt well with the midwives : and the people multiplied , and waxed very mighty .
and it came to pass , because the midwives feared God , that he made them houses .
and Pharaoh charged all his people , saying , Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
and there went a man * &#91; Amram &#93; of the house of Levi , and took to wife * &#91; Jachobed &#93; a daughter of Levi .
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river &apos;s brink .
and his sister stood afar off , to wit what would be done to him .
and the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river ; and her maidens walked along by the river &apos;s side ; and when she saw the ark among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
and when she had opened it , she saw the child : and , behold , the babe wept . and she had compassion on him , and said , This is one of the Hebrews &apos; children .
then said his sister to Pharaoh &apos;s daughter , Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for thee ?
and Pharaoh &apos;s daughter said to her , Go . and the maid went and called the child &apos;s mother .
and Pharaoh &apos;s daughter said unto her , Take this child away , and nurse it for me , and I will give thee thy wages . and the women took the child , and nursed it .
and the child grew , and she brought him unto Pharaoh &apos;s daughter , and he became her son . and she called his name Moses : and she said , Because I drew him out of the water .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
and when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the Hebrews strove together : and he said to him that did the wrong , Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
and he said , Who made thee a prince and a judge over us ? intendest thou to kill me , as thou killedst the Egyptian ? and Moses feared , and said , Surely this thing is known .
now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian : and he sat down by a well .
now the priest of Midian had seven daughters : and they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father &apos;s flock .
and the shepherds came and drove them away : but Moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
and when they came to Reuel their father , he said , How is it that ye are come so soon to day ?
and they said , An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and also drew water enough for us , and watered the flock .
and he said unto his daughters , And where is he ? why is it that ye have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread .
and Moses was content to dwell with the man : and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter .
and she bare him a son , and he called his name Gershom : for he said , I have been a stranger in a strange land .
and it came to pass in process of time , that the king of Egypt died : and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage , and they cried , and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage .
and God heard their groaning , and God remembered his covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .
and God looked upon the children of Israel , and God had respect unto them .
now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb
and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked , and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
and Moses said , I will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . and he said , &quot; Here am I. &quot;
and he said , Draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoes from off thy feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
and the Lord said , I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows ;
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flowing with milk and honey ; unto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
and Moses said unto God , Who am I , that I should go unto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
and he said , Certainly I will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that I have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mountain .
and Moses said unto God , Behold , when I come unto the children of Israel , and shall say unto them , The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you ; and they shall say to me , What is his name ? what shall I say unto them ?
and God said unto Moses , I Am That I Am : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I Am hath sent me unto you .
and God said moreover unto Moses , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , the Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath sent me unto you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations .
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , unto a land flowing with milk and honey .
and they shall hearken to thy voice : and thou shalt come , thou and the elders of Israel , unto the king of Egypt , and ye shall say unto him , The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us : and now let us go , we beseech thee , three days &apos; journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God .
and I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and I will stretch out my hand , and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
and I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians : and it shall come to pass , that , when ye go , ye shall not go empty .
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and Moses answered and said , But , behold , they will not believe me , nor hearken unto my voice : for they will say , The Lord hath not appeared unto thee .
and the Lord said unto him , What is that in thine hand ? and he said , A rod .
and he said , Cast it on the ground . and he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared unto thee .
and the Lord said furthermore unto him , Put now thine hand into thy bosom . and he put his hand into his bosom : and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
and he said , Put thine hand into thy bosom again . and he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the latter sign .
and it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
and Moses said unto the Lord , O my Lord , I am not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant : but I am slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
and the Lord said unto him , Who hath made man &apos;s mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the Lord ?
now therefore go , and I will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say .
and he said , O my Lord , send , I pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send .
and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . and also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart .
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people : and he shall be , even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God .
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do signs .
and Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law , and said unto him , Let me go , I pray thee , and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt , and see whether they be yet alive . and Jethro said to Moses , Go in peace .
and the Lord said unto Moses in Midian , Go , return into Egypt : for all the men are dead which sought thy life .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the Lord said unto Moses , When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand : but I will harden * his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh , Thus saith the Lord , Israel is my son , even my firstborn :
and I say unto thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will slay thy son , even thy firstborn .
and it came to pass by the way in the inn , that the Lord met him , and sought to kill him .
then Zipporah took a sharp stone , and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , Surely a bloody husband art thou to me .
so he let him go : then she said , A bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision .
and the Lord said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . and he went , and met him in the mount of God , and kissed him .
and Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him , and all the signs which he had commanded him .
and Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel :
and Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and the people believed : and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
and afterward Moses and Aaron went in , and told Pharaoh , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness .
and Pharaoh said , Who is the Lord , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go ? I know not the Lord , neither will I let Israel go .
and they said , The God of the Hebrews hath met with us : let us go , we pray thee , three days &apos; journey into the desert , and sacrifice unto the Lord our God ; lest he fall upon us with pestilence , or with the sword .
and the king of Egypt said unto them , Wherefore do ye , Moses and Aaron , let the people from their works ? get you unto your burdens .
and Pharaoh said , Behold , the people of the land now are many , and ye make them rest from their burdens .
and Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
and the tale of the bricks , which they did make heretofore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us go and sacrifice to our God .
let there more work be laid upon the men , that they may labour therein ; and let them not regard vain words .
and the taskmasters of the people went out , and their officers , and they spake to the people , saying , Thus saith Pharaoh , I will not give you straw .
go ye , get you straw where ye can find it : yet not ought of your work shall be diminished .
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw .
and the taskmasters hasted them , saying , Fulfill your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw .
and the officers of the children of Israel , which Pharaoh &apos;s taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh , saying , Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants ?
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
but he said , Ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , Let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be given you , yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks .
and the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case , after it was said , Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task .
and they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from Pharaoh :
and they said unto them , The Lord look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to slay us .
and Moses returned unto the Lord , and said , Lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people ? why is it that thou hast sent me ?
for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name , he hath done evil to this people ; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all .
then the Lord said unto Moses , Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and God spake unto Moses , and said unto him , I am the Lord :
and I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them .
and I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them .
and I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , wherein they were strangers .
and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bondage ; and I have remembered my covenant .
Wherefore say unto the children of Israel , I am the Lord , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians , and I will rid you out of their bondage , and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm , and with great judgments :
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the Lord .
and Moses spake so unto the children of Israel : but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
go in , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and Moses spake before the Lord , saying , Behold , the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me ; how then shall Pharaoh hear me , who am of uncircumcised lips ?
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
these be the heads of their fathers &apos; houses : the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel ; Hanoch , and Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi : these be the families of Reuben .
and the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman : these are the families of Simeon .
and these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations ; Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari : and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
the sons of Gershon ; Libni , and Shimi , according to their families .
and the sons of Kohath ; Amram , and Izhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel : and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years .
and the sons of Merari ; Mahali and Mushi : these are the families of Levi according to their generations .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father &apos;s sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and the sons of Izhar ; Korah , and Nepheg , and Zichri .
and the sons of Uzziel ; Mishael , and Elzaphan , and Zithri .
and Aaron took him Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Naashon , to wife ; and she bare him Nadab , and Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar .
and the sons of Korah ; Assir , and Elkanah , and Abiasaph : these are the families of the Korhites .
and Eleazar Aaron &apos;s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the Lord said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
and it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt ,
that the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , I am the Lord : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
and Moses said before the Lord , Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me ?
and the Lord said unto Moses , See , I have made thee a god to Pharaoh : and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
thou shalt speak all that I command thee : and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh , that he send the children of Israel out of his land .
and I will harden Pharaoh &apos;s heart , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt .
but Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
and Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them , so did they .
and Moses was fourscore years old , and Aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto Pharaoh .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying ,
when Pharaoh shall speak unto you , saying , Shew a miracle for you : then thou shalt say unto Aaron , Take thy rod , and cast it before Pharaoh , and it shall become a serpent .
and Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh , and they did so as the Lord had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh , and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers : now the magicians of Egypt , they also did in like manner with their enchantments .
for they cast down every man his rod , and they became serpents : but Aaron &apos;s rod swallowed up their rods .
and he hardened Pharaoh &apos;s heart , that he hearkened not unto them ; as the Lord had said .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Pharaoh &apos;s heart is hardened , he refuseth to let the people go .
get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river &apos;s brink against he come ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
and thou shalt say unto him , The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee , saying , Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou wouldest not hear .
thus saith the Lord , In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord : behold , I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and the fish that is in the river shall die , and the river shall stink ; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water of the river .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Take thy rod , and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt , upon their streams , upon their rivers , and upon their ponds , and upon all their pools of water , that they may become blood ; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt , both in vessels of wood , and in vessels of stone .
and Moses and Aaron did so , as the Lord commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and smote the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Pharaoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments : and Pharaoh &apos;s heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them ; as the Lord had said .
and Pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he set his heart to this also .
and all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and seven days were fulfilled , after that the Lord had smitten the river .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , Go unto Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and if thou refuse to let them go , behold , I will smite all thy borders with frogs :
and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly , which shall go up and come into thine house , and into thy bedchamber , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thine ovens , and into thy kneadingtroughs :
and the frogs shall come up both on thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
and Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments , and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , intreat the Lord , that he may take away the frogs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord .
and Moses said unto Pharaoh , Glory over me : when shall I intreat for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ?
and he said , To morrow . and he said , Be it according to thy word : that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God .
and the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh : and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
and they gathered them together upon heaps : and the land stank .
but when Pharaoh saw that there was respite , he hardened his heart , and hearkened not unto them ; as the Lord had said .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch out thy rod , and smite the dust of the land , that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : so there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
then the magicians said unto Pharaoh , This is the finger of God : and Pharaoh &apos;s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the Lord had said .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh ; lo , he cometh forth to the water ; and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thy houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
and I will sever in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no swarms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth .
and I will put a division between my people and thy people : to morrow shall this sign be .
and the Lord did so ; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh , and into his servants &apos; houses , and into all the land of Egypt : the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies .
and Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron , and said , Go ye , sacrifice to your God in the land .
and Moses said , It is not meet so to do ; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God : lo , shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes , and will they not stone us ?
we will go three days &apos; journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to the Lord our God , as he shall command us .
and Pharaoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : entreat for me .
and Moses said , Behold , I go out from thee , and I will intreat the Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , to morrow : but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord .
and Moses went out from Pharaoh , and entreated the Lord .
and the Lord did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
and Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also , neither would he let the people go .
then the Lord said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh , and tell him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for if thou refuse to let them go , and wilt hold them still ,
behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the camels , upon the oxen , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very grievous murrain .
and the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt : and there shall nothing die of all that is the children &apos;s of Israel .
and the Lord appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land .
and the Lord did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
and Pharaoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron , Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven ; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man , and upon beast .
and the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils ; for the boil was upon the magicians , and upon all the Egyptians .
and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to shew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
behold , to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field , and shall not be brought home , the hail shall come down upon them , and they shall die .
he that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every herb of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the Lord sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , was there no hail .
and Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said unto them , I have sinned this time : the Lord is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
intreat the Lord ( for it is enough ) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
and Moses said unto him , As soon as I am gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord ; and the thunder shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord &apos;s .
but as for thee and thy servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God .
and the flax and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled .
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten : for they were not grown up .
and Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go in unto Pharaoh : for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might shew these my signs before him :
and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son , and of thy son &apos;s son , what things I have wrought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the Lord .
and Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh , and said unto him , Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews , How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast :
and they shall cover the face of the earth , that one cannot be able to see the earth : and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped , which remaineth unto you from the hail , and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field :
and they shall fill thy houses , and the houses of all thy servants , and the houses of all the Egyptians ; which neither thy fathers , nor thy fathers &apos; fathers have seen , since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day . and he turned himself , and went out from Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh &apos;s servants said unto him , How long shall this man be a snare unto us ? let the men go , that they may serve the Lord their God : knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed ?
and Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh : and he said unto them , Go , serve the Lord your God : but who are they that shall go ?
and Moses said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord .
and he said unto them , Let the Lord be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for evil is before you .
not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the Lord ; for that ye did desire . and they were driven out from Pharaoh &apos;s presence .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and the locust went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the coasts of Egypt : very grievous were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them shall be such .
for they covered the face of the whole earth , so that the land was darkened ; and they did eat every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left : and there remained not any green thing in the trees , or in the herbs of the field , through all the land of Egypt .
then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste ; and he said , I have sinned against the Lord your God , and against you .
now therefore forgive , I pray thee , my sin only this once , and intreat the Lord your God , that he may take away from me this death only .
and he went out from Pharaoh , and intreated the Lord .
and the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind , which took away the locusts , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt .
but the Lord hardened Pharaoh &apos;s heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand toward heaven , that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt , even darkness which may be felt .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days : but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
and Pharaoh called unto Moses , and said , Go ye , serve the Lord ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed : let your little ones also go with you .
and Moses said , Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God .
our cattle also shall go with us ; there shall not an hoof be left behind ; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God ; and we know not with what we must serve the Lord , until we come thither .
but the Lord hardened Pharaoh &apos;s heart , and he would not let them go .
and Pharaoh said unto him , Get thee from me , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
and Moses said , Thou hast spoken well , I will see thy face again no more .
and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying ,
this month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel , saying , In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb , according to the house of their fathers , a lamb for an house :
and if the household be too little for the lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls ; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor sodden at all with water , but roast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the purtenance thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your loins girded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste : it is the Lord &apos;s passover .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the Lord .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I smite the land of Egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever .
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread ; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever .
in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , ye shall eat unleavened bread , until the one and twentieth day of the month at even .
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the passover .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
for the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel , and on the two side posts , the Lord will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you .
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you , according as he hath promised , that ye shall keep this service .
and it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , What mean ye by this service ?
that ye shall say , It is the sacrifice of the Lord &apos;s passover , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt , when he smote the Egyptians , and delivered our houses . and the people bowed the head and worshipped .
and the children of Israel went away , and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass , that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
and Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , Rise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the Lord , as ye have said .
also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
and the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment :
and the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they lent unto them such things as they required . and they spoiled the Egyptians .
and the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
and a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks , and herds , even very much cattle .
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
now the sojourning of the children of Israel , who dwelt in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , even the selfsame day it came to pass , that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt .
it is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out from the land of Egypt : this is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .
and the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron , This is the ordinance of the passover : there shall no stranger eat thereof :
but every man &apos;s servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof .
in one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
all the congregation of Israel shall keep it .
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee , and will keep the passover to the Lord , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it ; and he shall be as one that is born in the land : for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
one law shall be to him that is homeborn , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
thus did all the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass the selfsame day , that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
sanctify unto me all the firstborn , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
and Moses said unto the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eaten .
this day came ye out in the month Abib .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the Lord .
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters .
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the Lord &apos;s law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt .
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year .
and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites , as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix , and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the Lord &apos;s .
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb ; and if thou wilt not redeem it , then thou shalt break his neck : and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem .
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What is this ? that thou shalt say unto him , By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt , from the house of bondage :
and it came to pass , when Pharaoh would hardly let us go , that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both the firstborn of man , and the firstborn of beast : therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the matrix , being males ; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem .
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes : for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt .
and it came to pass , when Pharaoh had let the people go , that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines , although that was near ; for God said , Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and they return to Egypt :
but God led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt .
and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him : for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you .
and they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day , nor the pillar of fire by night , from before the people .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of Israel , that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth , between Migdol and the sea , over against Baalzephon : before it shall ye encamp by the sea .
for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and I will harden Pharaoh &apos;s heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host ; that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord . and they did so .
and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled : and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ?
and he made ready his chariot , and took his people with him :
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over every one of them .
and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
but the Egyptians pursued after them , all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , and his horsemen , and his army , and overtook them encamping by the sea , beside Pihahiroth , before Baalzephon .
and when Pharaoh drew nigh , the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and , behold , the Egyptians marched after them ; and they were sore afraid : and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord .
and they said unto Moses , Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and Moses said unto the people , Fear ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the Lord , which he will shew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
the Lord shall fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Wherefore criest thou unto me ? speak unto the children of Israel , that they go forward :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord , when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the angel of God , which went before the camp of Israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face , and stood behind them :
and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .
and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground : and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
and the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh &apos;s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
and it came to pass , that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and troubled the host of the Egyptians ,
and took off their chariot wheels , that they drave them heavily : so that the Egyptians said , Let us flee from the face of Israel ; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Stretch out thine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots , and upon their horsemen .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
and the waters returned , and covered the chariots , and the horsemen , and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them ; there remained not so much as one of them .
but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
and Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians : and the people feared the Lord , and believed the Lord , and his servant Moses .
then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the YHWH , and spake , saying , I will sing unto the YHWH , for he hath triumphed gloriously : the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
the YHWH is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an habitation ; my father &apos;s God , and I will exalt him .
the YHWH is a man of war : the YHWH is his name .
Pharaoh &apos;s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea : his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea .
the depths have covered them : they sank into the bottom as a stone .
thy right hand , O Lord , is become glorious in power : thy right hand , O Lord , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together , the floods stood upright as an heap , and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea .
the enemy said , I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my lust shall be satisfied upon them ; I will draw my sword , my hand shall destroy them .
thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea covered them : they sank as lead in the mighty waters .
who is like unto thee , O Lord , among the gods ? who is like thee , glorious in holiness , fearful in praises , doing wonders ?
thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
the people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina .
then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed ; the mighty men of Moab , trembling shall take hold upon them ; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away .
fear and dread shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , O Lord , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O Lord , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
the Lord shall reign for ever and ever .
for the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea .
and Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took a timbrel in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances .
and Miriam answered them , Sing ye to the Lord , for he hath triumphed gloriously ; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
so Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
and when they came to Marah , they could not drink of the waters of Marah , for they were bitter : therefore the name of it was called Marah .
and the people murmured against Moses , saying , What shall we drink ?
and he cried unto the Lord ; and the Lord shewed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordinance , and there he proved them ,
and said , If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God , and wilt do that which is right in his sight , and wilt give ear to his commandments , and keep all his statutes , I will put none of these diseases upon thee , which I have brought upon the Egyptians : for I am the Lord that healeth thee .
and they took their journey from Elim , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin , which is between Elim and Sinai , on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
and the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness :
and the children of Israel said unto them , Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt , when we sat by the flesh pots , and when we did eat bread to the full ; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger .
then said the Lord unto Moses , Behold , I will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day , that I may prove them , whether they will walk in my law , or no .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the Lord ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
and Moses said , This shall be , when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him : and what are we ? your murmurings are not against us , but against the Lord .
and Moses spake unto Aaron , Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , Come near before the Lord : for he hath heard your murmurings .
and it came to pass , as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and , behold , the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel : speak unto them , saying , At even ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread ; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God .
and it came to pass , that at even the quails came up , and covered the camp : and in the morning the dew lay round about the host .
and when the dew that lay was gone up , behold , upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing , as small as the hoar frost on the ground .
and when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is manna : for they wist not what it was . and Moses said unto them , This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat .
this is the thing which the Lord hath commanded , Gather of it every man according to his eating , an omer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
and the children of Israel did so , and gathered , some more , some less .
and when they did mete it with an omer , he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little had no lack ; they gathered every man according to his eating .
and Moses said , Let no man leave of it till the morning .
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
and they gathered it every morning , every man according to his eating : and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
and it came to pass , that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one man : and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
and he said unto them , This is that which the Lord hath said , To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord : bake that which ye will bake to day , and seethe that ye will seethe ; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning .
and they laid it up till the morning , as Moses bade : and it did not stink , neither was there any worm therein .
and Moses said , Eat that to day ; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and it came to pass , that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather , and they found none .
and the Lord said unto Moses , How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws ?
see , for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
so the people rested on the seventh day .
and the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna : and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey .
and Moses said , This is the thing which the Lord commandeth , Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Take a pot , and put an omer full of manna therein , and lay it up before the Lord , to be kept for your generations .
as the Lord commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony , to be kept .
and the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
and all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin , after their journeys , according to the commandment of the Lord , and pitched in Rephidim : and there was no water for the people to drink .
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses , and said , Give us water that we may drink . and Moses said unto them , Why chide ye with me ? Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord ?
and the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
and Moses cried unto the Lord , saying , What shall I do unto this people ? they be almost ready to stone me .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
and he called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because of the chiding of the children of Israel , and because they tempted the Lord , saying , Is the Lord among us , or not ?
then came Amalek , and fought with Israel in Rephidim .
and Moses said unto Joshua , Choose us out men , and go out , fight with Amalek : to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand .
so Joshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with Amalek : and Moses , Aaron , and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
but Moses hands were heavy ; and they took a stone , and put it under him , and he sat thereon ; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side ; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun .
and Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Write this for a memorial in a book , and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua : for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven .
and Moses built an altar , and called the name of it Jehovahnissi :
for he said , Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation .
when Jethro , the priest of Midian , Moses &apos; father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
then Jethro , Moses &apos; father in law , took Zipporah , Moses &apos; wife , after he had sent her back ,
and her two sons ; of which the name of the one was Gershom ; for he said , I have been an alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other was Eliezer ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh :
and Jethro , Moses &apos; father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God :
and he said unto Moses , I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee , and thy wife , and her two sons with her .
and Moses went out to meet his father in law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent .
and Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel &apos;s sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord delivered them .
and Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
and Jethro said , Blessed be the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods : for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them .
and Jethro , Moses &apos; father in law , took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God : and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses &apos; father in law before God .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening .
and when Moses &apos; father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou doest to the people ? why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
and Moses said unto his father in law , Because the people come unto me to enquire of God :
when they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
and Moses &apos; father in law said unto him , The thing that thou doest is not good .
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
hearken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : be thou for the people to God-ward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God :
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens :
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
so Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
and Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , rulers of thousands , rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens .
and they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
and Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
for they were departed from Rephidim , and were come to the desert of Sinai , and had pitched in the wilderness ; and there Israel camped before the mount .
and Moses went up unto God , and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians , and how I bare you on eagles &apos; wings , and brought you unto myself .
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation . these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel .
and Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him .
and all the people answered together , and said , All that the Lord hath spoken we will do . and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Lo , I come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when I speak with thee , and believe thee for ever . and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sanctify them to day and to morrow , and let them wash their clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death :
there shall not an hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned , or shot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount .
and Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
and he said unto the people , Be ready against the third day : come not at your wives .
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were thunders and lightnings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled .
and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
and mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke , because the Lord descended upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quaked greatly .
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed louder and louder , Moses spake , and God answered him by a voice .
and the Lord came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze , and many of them perish .
and let the priests also , which come near to the Lord , sanctify themselves , lest the Lord break forth upon them .
and Moses said unto the Lord , The people cannot come up to mount Sinai : for thou chargedst us , saying , Set bounds about the mount , and sanctify it .
and the Lord said unto him , Away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest he break forth upon them .
so Moses went down unto the people , and spake unto them .
and God spake all these words , saying ,
I am the Lord thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other gods before me .
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth .
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them : for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ;
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments .
thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain ; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work :
but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates :
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : Wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .
honour thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
thou shalt not commit adultery .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
thou shalt not covet thy neighbour &apos;s house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour &apos;s wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour &apos;s .
and all the people saw the thunderings , and the lightnings , and the noise of the trumpet , and the mountain smoking : and when the people saw it , they removed , and stood afar off .
and they said unto Moses , Speak thou with us , and we will hear : but let not God speak with us , lest we die .
and Moses said unto the people , Fear not : for God is come to prove you , and that his fear may be before your faces , that ye sin not .
and the people stood afar off , and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
ye shall not make with me gods of silver , neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold .
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me , and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings , and thy peace offerings , thy sheep , and thine oxen : in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee , and I will bless thee .
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone , thou shalt not build it of hewn stone : for if thou lift up thy tool upon it , thou hast polluted it .
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon .
now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them .
if thou buy an Hebrew servant , six years he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
if he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he were married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or daughters ; the wife and her children shall be her master &apos;s , and he shall go out by himself .
and if the servant shall plainly say , I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free :
then his master shall bring him unto the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door , or unto the door post ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul ; and he shall serve him for ever .
and if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant , she shall not go out as the menservants do .
if she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her .
and if he have betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
if he take him another wife ; her food , her raiment , and her duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
and if he do not these three unto her , then shall she go out free without money .
he that smiteth a man , so that he die , shall be surely put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand ; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
but if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour , to slay him with guile ; thou shalt take him from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth his father , or his mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth his father , or his mother , shall surely be put to death .
and if men strive together , and one smite another with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keepeth his bed :
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smote him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
and if a man smite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall be surely punished .
notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punished : for he is his money .
if men strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit depart from her , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punished , according as the woman &apos;s husband will lay upon him ; and he shall pay as the judges determine .
and if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
and if a man smite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye &apos;s sake .
and if he smite out his manservant &apos;s tooth , or his maidservant &apos;s tooth ; he shall let him go free for his tooth &apos;s sake .
if an ox gore a man or a woman , that they die : then the ox shall be surely stoned , and his flesh shall not be eaten ; but the owner of the ox shall be quit .
but if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past , and it hath been testified to his owner , and he hath not kept him in , but that he hath killed a man or a woman ; the ox shall be stoned , and his owner also shall be put to death .
if there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
whether he have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and an ox or an ass fall therein ;
the owner of the pit shall make it good , and give money unto the owner of them ; and the dead beast shall be his .
and if one man &apos;s ox hurt another &apos;s , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
if a man shall steal an ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five oxen for an ox , and four sheep for a sheep .
if a thief be found breaking up , and be smitten that he die , there shall no blood be shed for him .
if the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him ; for he should make full restitution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
if the theft be certainly found in his hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall restore double .
if a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten , and shall put in his beast , and shall feed in another man &apos;s field ; of the best of his own field , and of the best of his own vineyard , shall he make restitution .
if fire break out , and catch in thorns , so that the stacks of corn , or the standing corn , or the field , be consumed therewith ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution .
if a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man &apos;s house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour &apos;s goods .
for all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his , the cause of both parties shall come before the judges ; and whom the judges shall condemn , he shall pay double unto his neighbour .
if a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass , or an ox , or a sheep , or any beast , to keep ; and it die , or be hurt , or driven away , no man seeing it :
then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour &apos;s goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
and if it be stolen from him , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
if it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
and if a man borrow ought of his neighbour , and it be hurt , or die , the owner thereof being not with it , he shall surely make it good .
but if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be an hired thing , it came for his hire .
and if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely endow her to be his wife .
if her father utterly refuse to give her unto him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins .
thou shalt not suffer a witch to live .
whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death .
he that sacrificeth unto any god , save unto the Lord only , he shall be utterly destroyed .
thou shalt neither vex a stranger , nor oppress him : for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt .
ye shall not afflict any widow , or fatherless child .
if thou afflict them in any wise , and they cry at all unto me , I will surely hear their cry ;
and my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
if thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee , thou shalt not be to him as an usurer , neither shalt thou lay upon him usury .
if thou at all take thy neighbour &apos;s raiment to pledge , thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down :
for that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he crieth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gracious .
thou shalt not revile the gods , nor curse the ruler of thy people .
thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen , and with thy sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me .
and ye shall be holy men unto me : neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field ; ye shall cast it to the dogs .
thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment :
neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause .
if thou meet thine enemy &apos;s ox or his ass going astray , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause .
keep thee far from a false matter ; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not : for I will not justify the wicked .
and thou shalt take no gift : for the gift blindeth the wise , and perverteth the words of the righteous .
also thou shalt not oppress a stranger : for ye know the heart of a stranger , seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt .
and six years thou shalt sow thy land , and shalt gather in the fruits thereof :
but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still ; that the poor of thy people may eat : and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat . in like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard , and with thy oliveyard .
six days thou shalt do thy work , and on the seventh day thou shalt rest : that thine ox and thine ass may rest , and the son of thy handmaid , and the stranger , may be refreshed .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year .
thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread : ( thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days , as I commanded thee , in the time appointed of the month Abib ; for in it thou camest out from Egypt : and none shall appear before me empty : )
and the feast of harvest , the firstfruits of thy labours , which thou hast sown in the field : and the feast of ingathering , which is in the end of the year , when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field .
three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord God .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning .
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God . thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother &apos;s milk .
behold , I send an Angel before thee , to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared .
beware of him , and obey his voice , provoke him not ; for he will not pardon your transgressions : for my name is in him .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .
for mine Angel shall go before thee , and bring thee in unto the Amorites , and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites : and I will cut them off .
thou shalt not bow down to their gods , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but thou shalt utterly overthrow them , and quite break down their images .
and ye shall serve the Lord your God , and he shall bless thy bread , and thy water ; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee .
there shall nothing cast their young , nor be barren , in thy land : the number of thy days I will fulfil .
I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
and I will send hornets before thee , which shall drive out the Hivite , the Canaanite , and the Hittite , from before thee .
I will not drive them out from before thee in one year ; lest the land become desolate , and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
by little and little I will drive them out from before thee , until thou be increased , and inherit the land .
and I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines , and from the desert unto the river : for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand ; and thou shalt drive them out before thee .
thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor with their gods .
they shall not dwell in thy land , lest they make thee sin against me : for if thou serve their gods , it will surely be a snare unto thee .
and he said unto Moses , Come up unto the Lord , thou , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye afar off .
and Moses alone shall come near the Lord : but they shall not come nigh ; neither shall the people go up with him .
and Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , All the words which the Lord hath said will we do .
and Moses wrote all the words of the Lord , and rose up early in the morning , and builded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
and he sent young men of the children of Israel , which offered burnt offerings , and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord .
and Moses took half of the blood , and put it in basons ; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
and he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the Lord hath said will we do , and be obedient .
and Moses took the blood , and sprinkled it on the people , and said , Behold the blood of the covenant , which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words .
then went up Moses , and Aaron , Nadab , and Abihu , and seventy of the elders of Israel :
and they saw the God of Israel : and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone , and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness .
and upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand : also they saw God , and did eat and drink .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Come up to me into the mount , and be there : and I will give thee tables of stone , and a law , and commandments which I have written ; that thou mayest teach them .
and Moses rose up , and his minister Joshua : and Moses went up into the mount of God .
and he said unto the elders , Tarry ye here for us , until we come again unto you : and , behold , Aaron and Hur are with you : if any man have any matters to do , let him come unto them .
and Moses went up into the mount , and a cloud covered the mount .
and the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days : and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel .
and Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring me an offering : of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering .
and this is the offering which ye shall take of them ; gold , and silver , and brass ,
and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats &apos; hair ,
and rams &apos; skins dyed red , and badgers &apos; skins , and shittim wood ,
oil for the light , spices for anointing oil , and for sweet incense ,
onyx stones , and stones to be set in the ephod , and in the breastplate .
and let them make me a sanctuary ; that I may dwell among them .
according to all that I shew thee , after the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all the instruments thereof , even so shall ye make it .
and they shall make an ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
and thou shalt make staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold .
and thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark , that the ark may be borne with them .
the staves shall be in the rings of the ark : they shall not be taken from it .
and thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee .
and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and thou shalt make two cherubims of gold , of beaten work shalt thou make them , in the two ends of the mercy seat .
and make one cherub on the one end , and the other cherub on the other end : even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high , covering the mercy seat with their wings , and their faces shall look one to another ; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be .
and thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark ; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee .
and there I will meet with thee , and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat , from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony , of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel .
thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood : two cubits shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , and make thereto a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about , and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
and thou shalt make for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof .
over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table .
and thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold , that the table may be borne with them .
and thou shalt make the dishes thereof , and spoons thereof , and covers thereof , and bowls thereof , to cover withal : of pure gold shalt thou make them .
and thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway .
and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work shall the candlestick be made : his shaft , and his branches , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , shall be of the same .
and six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side :
three bowls made like unto almonds , with a knop and a flower in one branch ; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch , with a knop and a flower : so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick .
and in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds , with their knops and their flowers .
and there shall be a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick .
their knops and their branches shall be of the same : all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold .
and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it .
and the tongs thereof , and the snuffdishes thereof , shall be of pure gold .
of a talent of pure gold shall he make it , with all these vessels .
and look that thou make them after their pattern , which was shewed thee in the mount .
moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them .
the length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and every one of the curtains shall have one measure .
the five curtains shall be coupled together one to another ; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another .
and thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling ; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain , and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second ; that the loops may take hold one of another .
and thou shalt make fifty taches of gold , and couple the curtains together with the taches : and it shall be one tabernacle .
and thou shalt make curtains of goats &apos; hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle : eleven curtains shalt thou make .
the length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure .
and thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling , and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and thou shalt make fifty taches of brass , and put the taches into the loops , and couple the tent together , that it may be one .
and the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remaineth , shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle .
and a cubit on the one side , and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent , it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
and thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams &apos; skins dyed red , and a covering above of badgers &apos; skins .
and thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up .
ten cubits shall be the length of a board , and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board .
two tenons shall there be in one board , set in order one against another : thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle , twenty boards on the south side southward .
and thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
and for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards :
and their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards .
and two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
and they shall be coupled together beneath , and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring : thus shall it be for them both ; they shall be for the two corners .
and they shall be eight boards , and their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and thou shalt make bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle , for the two sides westward .
and the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end .

and thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches , that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony : and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy .

in the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail , which is before the testimony , Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the Lord : it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel .
and take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister unto me in the priest &apos;s office , even Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron &apos;s sons .
and thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty .

and take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister unto me in the priest &apos;s office , even Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron &apos;s sons .

and thou shalt gird them with girdles , Aaron and his sons , and put the bonnets on them : and the priest &apos;s office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute : and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons .
and thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock .
and thou shalt kill the bullock before the Lord , by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock , and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger , and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar .
and thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul that is above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and burn them upon the altar .
but the flesh of the bullock , and his skin , and his dung , shalt thou burn with fire without the camp : it is a sin offering .
thou shalt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and thou shalt slay the ram , and thou shalt take his blood , and sprinkle it round about upon the altar .
and thou shalt cut the ram in pieces , and wash the inwards of him , and his legs , and put them unto his pieces , and unto his head .
and thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar : it is a burnt offering unto the Lord : it is a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and thou shalt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
then shalt thou kill the ram , and take of his blood , and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron , and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons , and upon the thumb of their right hand , and upon the great toe of their right foot , and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
and thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar , and of the anointing oil , and sprinkle it upon Aaron , and upon his garments , and upon his sons , and upon the garments of his sons with him : and he shall be hallowed , and his garments , and his sons , and his sons &apos; garments with him .
also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump , and the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and the right shoulder ; for it is a ram of consecration :
and one loaf of bread , and one cake of oiled bread , and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord :
and thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord .
and thou shalt receive them of their hands , and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour before the Lord : it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
and thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron &apos;s consecration , and wave it for a wave offering before the Lord : and it shall be thy part .
and thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering , and the shoulder of the heave offering , which is waved , and which is heaved up , of the ram of the consecration , even of that which is for Aaron , and of that which is for his sons :
and it shall be Aaron &apos;s and his sons &apos; by a statute for ever from the children of Israel : for it is an heave offering : and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings , even their heave offering unto the Lord .
and the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons &apos; after him , to be anointed therein , and to be consecrated in them .
and that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days , when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place .
and thou shalt take the ram of the consecration , and seethe his flesh in the holy place .
and Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram , and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made , to consecrate and to sanctify them : but a stranger shall not eat thereof , because they are holy .
and if ought of the flesh of the consecrations , or of the bread , remain unto the morning , then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire : it shall not be eaten , because it is holy .
and thus shalt thou do unto Aaron , and to his sons , according to all things which I have commanded thee : seven days shalt thou consecrate them .
and thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement : and thou shalt cleanse the altar , when thou hast made an atonement for it , and thou shalt anoint it , to sanctify it .
seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar , and sanctify it ; and it shall be an altar most holy : whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy .
now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar ; two lambs of the first year day by day continually .
the one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning ; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even :
and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil ; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering .
and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even , and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning , and according to the drink offering thereof , for a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the Lord .
this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord : where I will meet you , to speak there unto thee .
and there I will meet with the children of Israel , and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory .
and I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation , and the altar : I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons , to minister to me in the priest &apos;s office .
and I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will be their God .
and they shall know that I am the Lord their God , that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , that I may dwell among them : I am the Lord their God .
and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon : of shittim wood shalt thou make it .
a cubit shall be the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof ; foursquare shall it be : and two cubits shall be the height thereof : the horns thereof shall be of the same .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , the top thereof , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns thereof ; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about .
and two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it , by the two corners thereof , upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it ; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal .
and thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with gold .
and thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with thee .
and Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning : when he dresseth the lamps , he shall burn incense upon it .
and when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even , he shall burn incense upon it , a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations .
ye shall offer no strange incense thereon , nor burnt sacrifice , nor meat offering ; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon .
and Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements : once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations : it is most holy unto the Lord .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
when thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number , then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord , when thou numberest them ; that there be no plague among them , when thou numberest them .
this they shall give , every one that passeth among them that are numbered , half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary : ( a shekel is twenty gerahs : ) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord .
every one that passeth among them that are numbered , from twenty years old and above , shall give an offering unto the Lord .
the rich shall not give more , and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel , when they give an offering unto the Lord , to make an atonement for your souls .
and thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel , and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation ; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the Lord , to make an atonement for your souls .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
thou shalt also make a laver of brass , and his foot also of brass , to wash withal : and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar , and thou shalt put water therein .
for Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat :
when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation , they shall wash with water , that they die not ; or when they come near to the altar to minister , to burn offering made by fire unto the Lord :
so they shall wash their hands and their feet , that they die not : and it shall be a statute for ever to them , even to him and to his seed throughout their generations .
moreover the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
take thou also unto thee principal spices , of pure myrrh five hundred shekels , and of sweet cinnamon half so much , even two hundred and fifty shekels , and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels ,
and of cassia five hundred shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , and of oil olive an hin :
and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment , an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary : it shall be an holy anointing oil .
and thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith , and the ark of the testimony ,
and the table and all his vessels , and the candlestick and his vessels , and the altar of incense ,
and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels , and the laver and his foot .
and thou shalt sanctify them , that they may be most holy : whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister unto me in the priest &apos;s office .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations .
upon man &apos;s flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you .
whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Take unto thee sweet spices , stacte , and onycha , and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense : of each shall there be a like weight :
and thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection after the art of the apothecary , tempered together , pure and holy :
and thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy .
and as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord .
whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereto , shall even be cut off from his people .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
see , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah :
and I have filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
to devise cunning works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of timber , to work in all manner of workmanship .
and I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
the tabernacle of the congregation , and the ark of the testimony , and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle ,
and the table and his furniture , and the pure candlestick with all his furniture , and the altar of incense ,
and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture , and the laver and his foot ,
and the cloths of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest &apos;s office ,
and the anointing oil , and sweet incense for the holy place : according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
speak thou also unto the children of Israel , saying , Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you .
ye shall keep the sabbath therefore ; for it is holy unto you : every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death : for whosoever doeth any work therein , that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest , holy to the Lord : whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death .
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
it is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refreshed .
and he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God .
and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount , the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron , and said unto him , Up , make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and Aaron said unto them , Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
and he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a graving tool , after he had made it a molten calf : and they said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made proclamation , and said , To morrow is a feast to the Lord .
and they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Go , get thee down ; for thy people , which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves :
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a molten calf , and have worshipped it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and the Lord said unto Moses , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
and Moses besought the Lord his God , and said , Lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak , and say , For mischief did he bring them out , to slay them in the mountains , and to consume them from the face of the earth ? turn from thy fierce wrath , and repent of this evil against thy people .
remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , thy servants , to whom thou swarest by thine own self , and saidst unto them , I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven , and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed , and they shall inherit it for ever .
and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people .
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , graven upon the tables .
and when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto Moses , There is a noise of war in the camp .
and he said , It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery , neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome : but the noise of them that sing do I hear .
and it came to pass , as soon as he came nigh unto the camp , that he saw the calf , and the dancing : and Moses &apos; anger waxed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and brake them beneath the mount .
and he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strawed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
and Moses said unto Aaron , What did this people unto thee , that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them ?
and Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
and I said unto them , Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
and when Moses saw that the people were naked ; ( for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies : )
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , Who is on the Lord &apos;s side ? let him come unto me . and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
and he said unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
and the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
for Moses had said , Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin .
and Moses returned unto the Lord , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin-- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and the Lord plagued the people , because they made the calf , which Aaron made .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Depart , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I sware unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , Unto thy seed will I give it :
and I will send an angel before thee ; and I will drive out the Canaanite , the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite :
unto a land flowing with milk and honey : for I will not go up in the midst of thee ; for thou art a stiffnecked people : lest I consume thee in the way .
and when the people heard these evil tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
for the Lord had said unto Moses , Say unto the children of Israel , Ye are a stiffnecked people : I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment , and consume thee : therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee , that I may know what to do unto thee .
and the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb .
and Moses took the tabernacle , and pitched it without the camp , afar off from the camp , and called it the tabernacle of the congregation . and it came to pass , that every one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation , which was without the camp .
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tabernacle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tabernacle , and the Lord talked with Moses .
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door : and all the people rose up and worshipped , every man in his tent door .
and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh unto his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his servant Joshua , the son of Nun , a young man , departed not out of the tabernacle .
and Moses said unto the Lord , See , thou sayest unto me , Bring up this people : and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me . yet thou hast said , I know thee by name , and thou hast also found grace in my sight .
now therefore , I pray thee , if I have found grace in thy sight , shew me now thy way , that I may know thee , that I may find grace in thy sight : and consider that this nation is thy people .
and he said , My presence shall go with thee , and I will give thee rest .
and he said unto him , If thy presence go not with me , carry us not up hence .
for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight ? is it not in that thou goest with us ? so shall we be separated , I and thy people , from all the people that are upon the face of the earth .
and the Lord said unto Moses , I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken : for thou hast found grace in my sight , and I know thee by name .
and he said , I beseech thee , shew me thy glory .
and he said , I will make all my goodness pass before thee , and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee ; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy .
and he said , Thou canst not see my face : for there shall no man see me , and live .
and the Lord said , Behold , there is a place by me , and thou shalt stand upon a rock :
and it shall come to pass , while my glory passeth by , that I will put thee in a clift of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by :
and I will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou brakest .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount .
and no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount .
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the Lord had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
and the Lord descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of the Lord .
and the Lord passed by before him , and proclaimed , The Lord , The Lord God , merciful and gracious , longsuffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children &apos;s children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and Moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped .
and he said , If now I have found grace in thy sight , O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee , go among us ; for it is a stiffnecked people ; and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us for thine inheritance .
and he said , Behold , I make a covenant : before all thy people I will do marvels , such as have not been done in all the earth , nor in any nation : and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord : for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee :
but ye shall destroy their altars , break their images , and cut down their groves :
for thou shalt worship no other god : for the Lord , whose name is Jealous , is a jealous God :
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ;
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep . seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , as I commanded thee , in the time of the month Abib : for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt .
all that openeth the matrix is mine ; and every firstling among thy cattle , whether ox or sheep , that is male .
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb : and if thou redeem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem . and none shall appear before me empty .
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year &apos;s end .
thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LordGod , the God of Israel .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God . thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother &apos;s milk .
and the Lord said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
and he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
and it came to pass , when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses &apos; hand , when he came down from the mount , that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and Moses called unto them ; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him : and Moses talked with them .
and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
and till Moses had done speaking with them , he put a vail on his face .
but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him , he took the vail off , until he came out . and he came out , and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses &apos; face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
and Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together , and said unto them , These are the words which the Lord hath commanded , that ye should do them .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the Lord : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day .
and Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the Lord commanded , saying ,
take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord : whosoever is of a willing heart , let him bring it , an offering of the Lord ; gold , and silver , and brass ,
and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats &apos; hair ,
and rams &apos; skins dyed red , and badgers &apos; skins , and shittim wood ,
and oil for the light , and spices for anointing oil , and for the sweet incense ,
and onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod , and for the breastplate .
and every wise hearted among you shall come , and make all that the Lord hath commanded ;
the tabernacle , his tent , and his covering , his taches , and his boards , his bars , his pillars , and his sockets ,
the ark , and the staves thereof , with the mercy seat , and the vail of the covering ,
the table , and his staves , and all his vessels , and the shewbread ,
the candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light ,
and the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle ,
the altar of burnt offering , with his brasen grate , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot ,
the hangings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court ,
the pins of the tabernacle , and the pins of the court , and their cords ,
the cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest &apos;s office .
and all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses .
and they came , every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the Lord &apos;s offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation , and for all his service , and for the holy garments .
and they came , both men and women , as many as were willing hearted , and brought bracelets , and earrings , and rings , and tablets , all jewels of gold : and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the Lord .
and every man , with whom was found blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats &apos; hair , and red skins of rams , and badgers &apos; skins , brought them .
every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the Lord &apos;s offering : and every man , with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service , brought it .
and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , both of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine linen .
and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats &apos; hair .
and the rulers brought onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ;
and spice , and oil for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
the children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord , every man and woman , whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work , which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses .
and Moses said unto the children of Israel , See , the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ;
and he hath filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ;
and to devise curious works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in the cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of wood , to make any manner of cunning work .
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .
them hath he filled with wisdom of heart , to work all manner of work , of the engraver , and of the cunning workman , and of the embroiderer , in blue , and in purple , in scarlet , and in fine linen , and of the weaver , even of them that do any work , and of those that devise cunning work .
then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whom the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary , according to all that the Lord had commanded .
and Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it :
and they received of Moses all the offering , which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it withal . and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning .
and all the wise men , that wrought all the work of the sanctuary , came every man from his work which they made ;
and they spake unto Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the Lord commanded to make .
and Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . so the people were restrained from bringing .
for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : with cherubims of cunning work made he them .
the length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : the curtains were all of one size .
and he coupled the five curtains one unto another : and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another .
and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling : likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain , in the coupling of the second .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
and he made fifty taches of gold , and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches : so it became one tabernacle .
and he made curtains of goats &apos; hair for the tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains he made them .
the length of one curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain : the eleven curtains were of one size .
and he coupled five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves .
and he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second .
and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
and he made a covering for the tent of rams &apos; skins dyed red , and a covering of badgers &apos; skins above that .
and he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood , standing up .
the length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
one board had two tenons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and he made boards for the tabernacle ; twenty boards for the south side southward :
and forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
and for the other side of the tabernacle , which is toward the north corner , he made twenty boards ,
and their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
and two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides .
and they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
and there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
and he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward .
and he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other .
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
and he made a vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : with cherubims made he it of cunning work .
and he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
and he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , of needlework ;
and the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
and Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood : two cubits and a half was the length of it , and a cubit and a half the breadth of it , and a cubit and a half the height of it :
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , to be set by the four corners of it ; even two rings upon the one side of it , and two rings upon the other side of it .
and he made staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark , to bear the ark .
and he made the mercy seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half was the length thereof , and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and he made two cherubims of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mercy seat ;
one cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side : out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
and the cherubims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims .
and he made the table of shittim wood : two cubits was the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof :
and he overlaid it with pure gold , and made thereunto a crown of gold round about .
also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about ; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof .
over against the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
and he made the candlestick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the candlestick ; his shaft , and his branch , his bowls , his knops , and his flowers , were of the same :
and six branches going out of the sides thereof ; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof :
three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch , a knop and a flower ; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch , a knop and a flower : so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick .
and in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds , his knops , and his flowers :
and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , and a knop under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
their knops and their branches were of the same : all of it was one beaten work of pure gold .
and he made his seven lamps , and his snuffers , and his snuffdishes , of pure gold .
of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof .
and he made the incense altar of shittim wood : the length of it was a cubit , and the breadth of it a cubit ; it was foursquare ; and two cubits was the height of it ; the horns thereof were of the same .
and he overlaid it with pure gold , both the top of it , and the sides thereof round about , and the horns of it : also he made unto it a crown of gold round about .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the staves to bear it withal .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
and he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood : five cubits was the length thereof , and five cubits the breadth thereof ; it was foursquare ; and three cubits the height thereof .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he overlaid it with brass .
and he made all the vessels of the altar , the pots , and the shovels , and the basons , and the fleshhooks , and the firepans : all the vessels thereof made he of brass .
and he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it .
and he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass , to be places for the staves .
and he made the staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with brass .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar , to bear it withal ; he made the altar hollow with boards .
and he made the laver of brass , and the foot of it of brass , of the lookingglasses of the women assembling , which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
and he made the court : on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen , an hundred cubits :
their pillars were twenty , and their brasen sockets twenty ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver .
and for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits , their pillars were twenty , and their sockets of brass twenty ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
and for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits , their pillars ten , and their sockets ten ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
and for the east side eastward fifty cubits .
the hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
and for the other side of the court gate , on this hand and that hand , were hangings of fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three .
all the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
and the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : and twenty cubits was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cubits , answerable to the hangings of the court .
and their pillars were four , and their sockets of brass four ; their hooks of silver , and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver .
and all the pins of the tabernacle , and of the court round about , were of brass .
this is the sum of the tabernacle , even of the tabernacle of testimony , as it was counted , according to the commandment of Moses , for the service of the Levites , by the hand of Ithamar , son to Aaron the priest .
and Bezaleel the son Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah , made all that the Lord commanded Moses .
and with him was Aholiab , son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
all the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place , even the gold of the offering , was twenty and nine talents , and seven hundred and thirty shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
and the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents , and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary :
a bekah for every man , that is , half a shekel , after the shekel of the sanctuary , for every one that went to be numbered , from twenty years old and upward , for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men .
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the vail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
and of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars , and overlaid their chapiters , and filleted them .
and the brass of the offering was seventy talents , and two thousand and four hundred shekels .
and therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and the brasen altar , and the brasen grate for it , and all the vessels of the altar ,
and the sockets of the court round about , and the sockets of the court gate , and all the pins of the tabernacle , and all the pins of the court round about .
and of the blue , and purple , and scarlet , they made cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he made the ephod of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
and they did beat the gold into thin plates , and cut it into wires , to work it in the blue , and in the purple , and in the scarlet , and in the fine linen , with cunning work .
they made shoulder pieces for it , to couple it together : by the two edges was it coupled together .
and the curious girdle of his ephod , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold , graven , as signets are graven , with the names of the children of Israel .
and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he made the breastplate of cunning work , like the work of the ephod ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
it was foursquare ; they made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
and they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a sardius , a topaz , and a carbuncle : this was the first row .
and the second row , an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond .
and the third row , a ligure , an agate , and an amethyst .
and the fourth row , a beryl , an onyx , and a jasper : they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings .
and the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel , twelve , according to their names , like the engravings of a signet , every one with his name , according to the twelve tribes .
and they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends , of wreathen work of pure gold .
and they made two ouches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate .
and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate .
and the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
and they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ephod inward .
and they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
and they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he made the robe of the ephod of woven work , all of blue .
and there was an hole in the midst of the robe , as the hole of an habergeon , with a band round about the hole , that it should not rend .
and they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined linen .
and they made bells of pure gold , and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe , round about between the pomegranates ;
a bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , round about the hem of the robe to minister in ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron , and for his sons ,
and a mitre of fine linen , and goodly bonnets of fine linen , and linen breeches of fine twined linen ,
and a girdle of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , of needlework ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , Holiness To The Lord .
and they tied unto it a lace of blue , to fasten it on high upon the mitre ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished : and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so did they .
and they brought the tabernacle unto Moses , the tent , and all his furniture , his taches , his boards , his bars , and his pillars , and his sockets ,
and the covering of rams &apos; skins dyed red , and the covering of badgers &apos; skins , and the vail of the covering ,
the ark of the testimony , and the staves thereof , and the mercy seat ,
the table , and all the vessels thereof , and the shewbread ,
the pure candlestick , with the lamps thereof , even with the lamps to be set in order , and all the vessels thereof , and the oil for light ,
and the golden altar , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the tabernacle door ,
the brasen altar , and his grate of brass , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot ,
the hangings of the court , his pillars , and his sockets , and the hanging for the court gate , his cords , and his pins , and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle , for the tent of the congregation ,
the cloths of service to do service in the holy place , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and his sons &apos; garments , to minister in the priest &apos;s office .
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses , so the children of Israel made all the work .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they had done it as the Lord had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
and the Lord spake unto Moses , saying ,
on the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony , and cover the ark with the vail .
and thou shalt bring in the table , and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it ; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick , and light the lamps thereof .
and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony , and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle .
and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the hanging at the court gate .
and thou shalt take the anointing oil , and anoint the tabernacle , and all that is therein , and shalt hallow it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering , and all his vessels , and sanctify the altar : and it shall be an altar most holy .
and thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot , and sanctify it .
and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , and wash them with water .
and thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest &apos;s office .
and thou shalt bring his sons , and clothe them with coats :
and thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest &apos;s office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
thus did Moses : according to all that the Lord commanded him , so did he .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
and Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
and he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark :
and he brought the ark into the tabernacle , and set up the vail of the covering , and covered the ark of the testimony ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he put the table in the tent of the congregation , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the vail .
and he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord ; as the Lord had commanded Moses .
and he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation , over against the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
and he lighted the lamps before the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail :
and he burnt sweet incense thereon ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle .
and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash withal .
and Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat :
when they went into the tent of the congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the Lord commanded Moses .
and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so Moses finished the work .
then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys :
but if the cloud were not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
for the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day , and fire was on it by night , in the sight of all the house of Israel , throughout all their journeys .
psalms
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the way of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful .
but his delight is in the law of the Lord ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
the ungodly are not so : but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away .
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous .
for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly shall perish .
why do the heathen rage , and the people imagine a vain thing ?
the kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the Lord , and against his anointed , saying ,
let us break their bands asunder , and cast away their cords from us .
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh : the Lord shall have them in derision .
then shall he speak unto them in his wrath , and vex them in his sore displeasure .
yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion .
I will declare the decree : the Lord hath said unto me , Thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee .
ask of me , and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession .
thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter &apos;s vessel .
be wise now therefore , O ye kings : be instructed , ye judges of the earth .
serve the Lord with fear , and rejoice with trembling .
kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
Lord , how are they increased that trouble me ! many are they that rise up against me .
many there be which say of my soul , There is no help for him in God . Selah .
but thou , O Lord , art a shield for me ; my glory , and the lifter up of mine head .
I cried unto the Lord with my voice , and he heard me out of his holy hill . Selah .
I laid me down and slept ; I awaked ; for the Lord sustained me .
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people , that have set themselves against me round about .
arise , O Lord ; save me , O my God : for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone ; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly .
salvation belongeth unto the Lord : thy blessing is upon thy people . Selah .
hear me when I call , O God of my righteousness : thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress ; have mercy upon me , and hear my prayer .
O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love vanity , and seek after leasing ? Selah .
but know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself : the Lord will hear when I call unto him .
stand in awe , and sin not : commune with your own heart upon your bed , and be still . Selah .
offer the sacrifices of righteousness , and put your trust in the Lord .
there be many that say , Who will shew us any good ? Lord , lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us .
thou hast put gladness in my heart , more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased .
I will both lay me down in peace , and sleep : for thou , Lord , only makest me dwell in safety .
give ear to my words , O Lord , consider my meditation .
hearken unto the voice of my cry , my King , and my God : for unto thee will I pray .
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning , O Lord ; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
for thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hatest all workers of iniquity .
thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing : the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man .
but as for me , I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy : and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple .
lead me , O Lord , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies ; make thy way straight before my face .
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth ; their inward part is very wickedness ; their throat is an open sepulchre ; they flatter with their tongue .
destroy thou them , O God ; let them fall by their own counsels ; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions ; for they have rebelled against thee .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
for thou , Lord , wilt bless the righteous ; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield .
O Lord , rebuke me not in thine anger , neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure .
have mercy upon me , O Lord ; for I am weak : O Lord , heal me ; for my bones are vexed .
my soul is also sore vexed : but thou , O Lord , how long ?
return , O Lord , deliver my soul : Oh save me for thy mercies &apos; sake .
for in death there is no remembrance of thee : in the grave who shall give thee thanks ?
I am weary with my groaning ; all the night make I my bed to swim ; I water my couch with my tears .
mine eye is consumed because of grief ; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies .
depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity ; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping .
the Lord hath heard my supplication ; the Lord will receive my prayer .
let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed : let them return and be ashamed suddenly .
O Lord , our Lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth ! who hast set thy glory above the heavens .
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies , that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger .
when I consider thy heavens , the work of thy fingers , the moon and the stars , which thou hast ordained ;
what is man , that thou art mindful of him ? and the son of man , that thou visitest him ?
for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels , and hast crowned him with glory and honour .
thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands ; thou hast put all things under his feet :
all sheep and oxen , yea , and the beasts of the field ;
the fowl of the air , and the fish of the sea , and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas .
O Lord our Lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth !
Lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
he that walketh uprightly , and worketh righteousness , and speaketh the truth in his heart .
he that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doeth evil to his neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour .
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned ; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord . he that sweareth to his own hurt , and changeth not .
he that putteth not out his money to usury , nor taketh reward against the innocent . he that doeth these things shall never be moved .
the heavens declare the glory of God ; and the firmament sheweth his handywork .
day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto night sheweth knowledge .
there is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard .
their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race .
his going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof .
the law of the Lord is perfect , converting the soul : the testimony of the Lord is sure , making wise the simple .
the statutes of the Lord are right , rejoicing the heart : the commandment of the Lord is pure , enlightening the eyes .
the fear of the Lord is clean , enduring for ever : the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether .
more to be desired are they than gold , yea , than much fine gold : sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb .
moreover by them is thy servant warned : and in keeping of them there is great reward .
who can understand his errors ? cleanse thou me from secret faults .
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not have dominion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be innocent from the great transgression .
let the words of my mouth , and the meditation of my heart , be acceptable in thy sight , O Lord , my strength , and my redeemer .
the Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want .
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters .
he restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name &apos;s sake .
yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life : and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever .
the Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
when the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat up my flesh , they stumbled and fell .
though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me , in this will I be confident .
one thing have I desired of the Lord , that will I seek after ; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life , to behold the beauty of the Lord , and to enquire in his temple .
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me : therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy ; I will sing , yea , I will sing praises unto the Lord .
hear , O Lord , when I cry with my voice : have mercy also upon me , and answer me .
when thou saidst , Seek ye my face ; my heart said unto thee , Thy face , Lord , will I seek .
hide not thy face far from me ; put not thy servant away in anger : thou hast been my help ; leave me not , neither forsake me , O God of my salvation .
when my father and my mother forsake me , then the Lord will take me up .
teach me thy way , O Lord , and lead me in a plain path , because of mine enemies .
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as breathe out cruelty .
I had fainted , unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living .
wait on the Lord : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen thine heart : wait , I say , on the Lord .
I said , I will take heed to my ways , that I sin not with my tongue : I will keep my mouth with a bridle , while the wicked is before me .
I was dumb with silence , I held my peace , even from good ; and my sorrow was stirred .
my heart was hot within me , while I was musing the fire burned : then spake I with my tongue ,
Lord , make me to know mine end , and the measure of my days , what it is : that I may know how frail I am .
behold , thou hast made my days as an handbreadth ; and mine age is as nothing before thee : verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity . Selah .
surely every man walketh in a vain shew : surely they are disquieted in vain : he heapeth up riches , and knoweth not who shall gather them .
and now , Lord , what wait I for ? my hope is in thee .
deliver me from all my transgressions : make me not the reproach of the foolish .
I was dumb , I opened not my mouth ; because thou didst it .
remove thy stroke away from me : I am consumed by the blow of thine hand .
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity , thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth : surely every man is vanity . Selah .
hear my prayer , O Lord , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not thy peace at my tears : for I am a stranger with thee , and a sojourner , as all my fathers were .
O spare me , that I may recover strength , before I go hence , and be no more .
as the hart panteth after the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , O God .
my soul thirsteth for God , for the living God : when shall I come and appear before God ?
my tears have been my meat day and night , while they continually say unto me , Where is thy God ?
when I remember these things , I pour out my soul in me : for I had gone with the multitude , I went with them to the house of God , with the voice of joy and praise , with a multitude that kept holyday .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted in me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance .
O my God , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Hermonites , from the hill Mizar .
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts : all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me .
yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the day time , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
I will say unto God my rock , Why hast thou forgotten me ? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
as with a sword in my bones , mine enemies reproach me ; while they say daily unto me , Where is thy God ?
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou disquieted within me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my countenance , and my God .
God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea ;
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled , though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof . Selah .
there is a river , the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God , the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High .
God is in the midst of her ; she shall not be moved : God shall help her , and that right early .
the heathen raged , the kingdoms were moved : he uttered his voice , the earth melted .
the Lord of hosts is with us ; the God of Jacob is our refuge . Selah .
come , behold the works of the Lord , what desolations he hath made in the earth .
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth ; he breaketh the bow , and cutteth the spear in sunder ; he burneth the chariot in the fire .
be still , and know that I am God : I will be exalted among the heathen , I will be exalted in the earth .
the Lord of hosts is with us ; the God of Jacob is our refuge . Selah .
have mercy upon me , O God , according to thy loving kindness : according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions .
wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity , and cleanse me from my sin .
for I acknowledge my transgressions : and my sin is ever before me .
against thee , thee only , have I sinned , and done this evil in thy sight : that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest , and be clear when thou judgest .
behold , I was shapen in iniquity ; and in sin did my mother conceive me .
behold , thou desirest truth in the inward parts : and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom .
purge me with hyssop , and I shall be clean : wash me , and I shall be whiter than snow .
make me to hear joy and gladness ; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice .
hide thy face from my sins , and blot out all mine iniquities .
create in me a clean heart , O God ; and renew a right spirit within me .
cast me not away from thy presence ; and take not thy holy spirit from me .
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation ; and uphold me with thy free spirit .
then will I teach transgressors thy ways ; and sinners shall be converted unto thee .
deliver me from bloodguiltiness , O God , thou God of my salvation : and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness .
O Lord , open thou my lips ; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise .
for thou desirest not sacrifice ; else would I give it : thou delightest not in burnt offering .
the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , O God , thou wilt not despise .
do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion : build thou the walls of Jerusalem .
then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness , with burnt offering and whole burnt offering : then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar .
give the king thy judgments , O God , and thy righteousness unto the king &apos;s son .
he shall judge thy people with righteousness , and thy poor with judgment .
the mountains shall bring peace to the people , and the little hills , by righteousness .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor .
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure , throughout all generations .
he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass : as showers that water the earth .
in his days shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth .
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river unto the ends of the earth .
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him ; and his enemies shall lick the dust .
the kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents : the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts .
yea , all kings shall fall down before him : all nations shall serve him .
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth ; the poor also , and him that hath no helper .
he shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of the needy .
he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence : and precious shall their blood be in his sight .
and he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba : prayer also shall be made for him continually ; and daily shall he be praised .
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
his name shall endure for ever : his name shall be continued as long as the sun : and men shall be blessed in him : all nations shall call him blessed .
blessed be the Lord God , the God of Israel , who only doeth wondrous things .
and blessed be his glorious name for ever : and let the whole earth be filled with his glory ; Amen , and Amen .
the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended .
how amiable are thy tabernacles , O Lord of hosts !
my soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of the Lord : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God .
yea , the sparrow hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even thine altars , O Lord of hosts , my King , and my God .
blessed are they that dwell in thy house : they will be still praising thee . Selah .
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee ; in whose heart are the ways of them .
who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well ; the rain also filleth the pools .
they go from strength to strength , every one of them in Zion appeareth before God .
O Lord God of hosts , hear my prayer : give ear , O God of Jacob . Selah .
behold , O God our shield , and look upon the face of thine anointed .
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
for the Lord God is a sun and shield : the Lord will give grace and glory : no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly .
O Lord of hosts , blessed is the man that trusteth in thee .
Lord , thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations .
before the mountains were brought forth , or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , thou art God .
thou turnest man to destruction ; and sayest , Return , ye children of men .
for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night .
thou carriest them away as with a flood ; they are as a sleep : in the morning they are like grass which groweth up .
in the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it is cut down , and withereth .
for we are consumed by thine anger , and by thy wrath are we troubled .
thou hast set our iniquities before thee , our secret sins in the light of thy countenance .
for all our days are passed away in thy wrath : we spend our years as a tale that is told .
the days of our years are threescore years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years , yet is their strength labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away .
who knoweth the power of thine anger ? even according to thy fear , so is thy wrath .
so teach us to number our days , that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom .
return , O Lord , how long ? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants .
O satisfy us early with thy mercy ; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days .
make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us , and the years wherein we have seen evil .
let thy work appear unto thy servants , and thy glory unto their children .
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands establish thou it .
make a joyful noise unto the Lord , all ye lands .
serve the Lord with gladness : come before his presence with singing .
know ye that the Lord he is God : it is he that hath made us , and not we ourselves ; we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
enter into his gates with thanksgiving , and into his courts with praise : be thankful unto him , and bless his name .
for the Lord is good ; his mercy is everlasting ; and his truth endureth to all generations .
bless the Lord , O my soul : and all that is within me , bless his holy name .
bless the Lord , O my soul , and forget not all his benefits :
who forgiveth all thine iniquities ; who healeth all thy diseases ;
who redeemeth thy life from destruction ; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies ;
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things ; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle &apos;s .
the Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed .
he made known his ways unto Moses , his acts unto the children of Israel .
the Lord is merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and plenteous in mercy .
he will not always chide : neither will he keep his anger for ever .
he hath not dealt with us after our sins ; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities .
for as the heaven is high above the earth , so great is his mercy toward them that fear him .
as far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our transgressions from us .
like as a father pitieth his children , so the Lord pitieth them that fear him .
for he knoweth our frame ; he remembereth that we are dust .
as for man , his days are as grass : as a flower of the field , so he flourisheth .
for the wind passeth over it , and it is gone ; and the place thereof shall know it no more .
but the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him , and his righteousness unto children &apos;s children ;
to such as keep his covenant , and to those that remember his commandments to do them .
the Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens ; and his kingdom ruleth over all .
bless the Lord , ye his angels , that excel in strength , that do his commandments , hearkening unto the voice of his word .
bless ye the Lord , all ye his hosts ; ye ministers of his , that do his pleasure .
bless the Lord , all his works in all places of his dominion : bless the Lord , O my soul .
I love the Lord , because he hath heard my voice and my supplications .
because he hath inclined his ear unto me , therefore will I call upon him as long as I live .
the sorrows of death compassed me , and the pains of hell gat hold upon me : I found trouble and sorrow .
then called I upon the name of the Lord ; O Lord , I beseech thee , deliver my soul .
gracious is the Lord , and righteous ; yea , our God is merciful .
the Lord preserveth the simple : I was brought low , and he helped me .
return unto thy rest , O my soul ; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee .
for thou hast delivered my soul from death , mine eyes from tears , and my feet from falling .
I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living .
I believed , therefore have I spoken : I was greatly afflicted :
I said in my haste , All men are liars .
what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me ?
I will take the cup of salvation , and call upon the name of the Lord .
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people .
precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints .
O Lord , truly I am thy servant ; I am thy servant , and the son of thine handmaid : thou hast loosed my bonds .
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving , and will call upon the name of the Lord .
I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people .
in the courts of the Lord &apos;s house , in the midst of thee , O Jerusalem . praise ye the Lord .
O praise the Lord , all ye nations : praise him , all ye people .
for his merciful kindness is great toward us : and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever . praise ye the Lord .
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help .
my help cometh from the Lord , which made heaven and earth .
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved : he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
behold , he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep .
the Lord is thy keeper : the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand .
the sun shall not smite thee by day , nor the moon by night .
the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil : he shall preserve thy soul .
the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth , and even for evermore .
I was glad when they said unto me , Let us go into the house of the Lord .
our feet shall stand within thy gates , O Jerusalem .
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together :
whither the tribes go up , the tribes of the Lord , unto the testimony of Israel , to give thanks unto the name of the Lord .
for there are set thrones of judgment , the thrones of the house of David .
pray for the peace of Jerusalem : they shall prosper that love thee .
peace be within thy walls , and prosperity within thy palaces .
for my brethren and companions &apos; sakes , I will now say , Peace be within thee .
because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good .
behold , how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity !
it is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron &apos;s beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
as the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion : for there the Lord commanded the blessing , even life for evermore .
by the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof .
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mirth , saying , Sing us one of the songs of Zion .
how shall we sing the Lord &apos;s song in a strange land ?
if I forget thee , O Jerusalem , let my right hand forget her cunning .
if I do not remember thee , let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy .
remember , O Lord , the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem ; who said , Rase it , rase it , even to the foundation thereof .
O daughter of Babylon , who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be , that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us .
happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones .
O lord , thou hast searched me , and known me .
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising , thou understandest my thought afar off .
thou compassest my path and my lying down , and art acquainted with all my ways .
for there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , O Lord , thou knowest it altogether .
thou hast beset me behind and before , and laid thine hand upon me .
such knowledge is too wonderful for me ; it is high , I cannot attain unto it .
whither shall I go from thy spirit ? or whither shall I flee from thy presence ?
if I ascend up into heaven , thou art there : if I make my bed in hell , behold , thou art there .
if I take the wings of the morning , and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea ;
even there shall thy hand lead me , and thy right hand shall hold me .
if I say , Surely the darkness shall cover me ; even the night shall be light about me .
yea , the darkness hideth not from thee ; but the night shineth as the day : the darkness and the light are both alike to thee .
for thou hast possessed my reins : thou hast covered me in my mother &apos;s womb .
I will praise thee ; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made : marvellous are thy works ; and that my soul knoweth right well .
my substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in thy book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me , O God ! how great is the sum of them !
if I should count them , they are more in number than the sand : when I awake , I am still with thee .
surely thou wilt slay the wicked , O God : depart from me therefore , ye bloody men .
for they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain .
do not I hate them , O Lord , that hate thee ? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
I hate them with perfect hatred : I count them mine enemies .
search me , O God , and know my heart : try me , and know my thoughts :
and see if there be any wicked way in me , and lead me in the way everlasting .
the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz , which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah .
hear , O heavens , and give ear , O earth : for the Lord hath spoken , I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me .
the ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master &apos;s crib : but Israel doth not know , my people doth not consider .
Ah sinful nation , a people laden with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , children that are corrupters : they have forsaken the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger , they are gone away backward .
why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
your country is desolate , your cities are burned with fire : your land , strangers devour it in your presence , and it is desolate , as overthrown by strangers .
and the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as Sodom , and we should have been like unto Gomorrah .
hear the word of the Lord , ye rulers of Sodom ; give ear unto the law of our God , ye people of Gomorrah .
to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ? saith the Lord : I am full of the burnt offerings of rams , and the fat of fed beasts ; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks , or of lambs , or of he goats .
when ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your hand , to tread my courts ?
bring no more vain oblations ; incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths , the calling of assemblies , I cannot away with ; it is iniquity , even the solemn meeting .
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth : they are a trouble unto me ; I am weary to bear them .
and when ye spread forth your hands , I will hide mine eyes from you : yea , when ye make many prayers , I will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
learn to do well ; seek judgment , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow .
come now , and let us reason together , saith the Lord : though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool .
if ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land :
but if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword : for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it .
how is the faithful city become an harlot ! it was full of judgment ; righteousness lodged in it ; but now murderers .
thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water :
thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them .
therefore saith the Lord , the Lord of hosts , the mighty One of Israel , Ah , I will ease me of mine adversaries , and avenge me of mine enemies :
and I will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy dross , and take away all thy tin :
and I will restore thy judges as at the first , and thy counsellors as at the beginning : afterward thou shalt be called , The city of righteousness , the faithful city .
Zion shall be redeemed with judgment , and her converts with righteousness .
and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together , and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed .
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired , and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen .
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth , and as a garden that hath no water .
and the strong shall be as tow , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
the word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord &apos;s house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be exalted above the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it .
and many people shall go and say , Come ye , and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways , and we will walk in his paths : for out of Zion shall go forth the law , and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem .
and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : Nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
O house of Jacob , come ye , and let us walk in the light of the Lord .
therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob , because they be replenished from the east , and are soothsayers like the Philistines , and they please themselves in the children of strangers .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their chariots :
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
and the mean man boweth down , and the great man humbleth himself : therefore forgive them not .
enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
for the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty , and upon every one that is lifted up ; and he shall be brought low :
and upon all the cedars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of Bashan ,
and upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ,
and upon every high tower , and upon every fenced wall ,
and upon all the ships of Tarshish , and upon all pleasant pictures .
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day .
and the idols he shall utterly abolish .
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks , and into the caves of the earth , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
to go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the tops of the ragged rocks , for fear of the Lord , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils : for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
the proverbs of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel ;
to know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ;
to receive the instruction of wisdom , justice , and judgment , and equity ;
to give subtilty to the simple , to the young man knowledge and discretion .
a wise man will hear , and will increase learning ; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels :
to understand a proverb , and the interpretation ; the words of the wise , and their dark sayings .
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge : but fools despise wisdom and instruction .
my son , hear the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the law of thy mother :
for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck .
my son , if sinners entice thee , consent thou not .
if they say , Come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause :
let us swallow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit :
we shall find all precious substance , we shall fill our houses with spoil :
cast in thy lot among us ; let us all have one purse :
my son , walk not thou in the way with them ; refrain thy foot from their path :
for their feet run to evil , and make haste to shed blood .
surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird .
and they lay wait for their own blood ; they lurk privily for their own lives .
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain ; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof .
wisdom crieth without ; she uttereth her voice in the streets :
she crieth in the chief place of concourse , in the openings of the gates : in the city she uttereth her words , saying ,
how long , ye simple ones , will ye love simplicity ? and the scorners delight in their scorning , and fools hate knowledge ?
turn you at my reproof : behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you , I will make known my words unto you .
because I have called , and ye refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no man regarded ;
but ye have set at nought all my counsel , and would none of my reproof :
I also will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when your fear cometh ;
when your fear cometh as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you .
then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me :
for that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the Lord :
they would none of my counsel : they despised all my reproof .
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own devices .
for the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them .
but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely , and shall be quiet from fear of evil .
my son , keep my words , and lay up my commandments with thee .
keep my commandments , and live ; and my law as the apple of thine eye .
bind them upon thy fingers , write them upon the table of thine heart .
say unto wisdom , Thou art my sister ; and call understanding thy kinswoman :
that they may keep thee from the strange &#91; prostitute &#93; woman , from the stranger &#91; prostitute &#93; which flattereth with her words .
for at the window of my house I looked through my casement ,
and beheld among the simple ones , I discerned among the youths , a young man void of understanding ,
passing through the street near her corner ; and he went the way to her house ,
in the twilight , in the evening , in the black and dark night :
and , behold , there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot &#91; prostitute &#93; , and subtil of heart .
( she is loud and stubborn ; her feet abide not in her house : &#91; euphemism for a prostitute &#93;
now is she without , now in the streets , and lieth in wait at every corner . )
so she caught him , and kissed him , and with an impudent face said unto him ,
I have peace offerings with me ; this day have I payed my vows .
therefore came I forth to meet thee , diligently to seek thy face , and I have found thee .
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry , with carved works , with fine linen of Egypt .
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh , aloes , and cinnamon .
come , let us take our fill of love until the morning : let us solace ourselves with loves .
for the goodman is not at home , he is gone a long journey :
he hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
with her much fair speech she caused him to yield , with the flattering of her lips she forced &#91; compelled / persuaded &#93; him
he goeth after her straightway , as an ox goeth to the slaughter , or as a fool to the correction of the stocks ;
till a dart strike through his liver ; as a bird hasteth to the snare , and knoweth not that it is for his life .
hearken unto me now therefore , O ye children , and attend to the words of my mouth .
let not thine heart decline to her ways , go not astray in her paths .
for she hath cast down many wounded : yea , many strong men have been slain by her .
her house is the way to hell , going down to the chambers of death .
